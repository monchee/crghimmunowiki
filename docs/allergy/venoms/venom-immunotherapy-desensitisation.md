# Expected Outcome

This procedure will reduce the chance of a patient sustaining a potentially life threatening reaction to an insect sting

# Protocol / Guideline Statement
> - This policy relates to the procedure of desensitisation to stinging insects.
> - The procedure is to be performed only by an allergy trained registered nurse/registrar/doctor familiar with the protocol/guideline procedure.
> - An IV cannula is inserted into a peripheral vein of all patients prior to commencement of the desensitisation.
> - Adrenaline and IV hydrocortisone should be available and ready to use at the patient's bedside throughout the procedure.
> - Provided there has been no systemic symptoms during the procedure and the patient has been reviewed by the Consultant, patients can be discharged two hours after the last injection.
> - Patients that have systemic symptoms during the procedure, must be given treatment as per protocol and monitored for four hours prior to discharge once reviewed by the Consultant.

# Background
Hypersensitivity to venom from stinging insects can be life threatening. In South Western Sydney, the major offenders are the honey bee (Apis Mellifera) and paper wasp (Polisfes).

Patients who have had a systemic reaction to a sting (defined as symptoms of urticarial/angioedema, dizziness, dyspnoea/wheezing, hoarseness or loss of consciousness) require skin prick testing. Patients with positive results (is, reaction to 1 mcg or less venom) should be offered immunotherapy. In addition, each patient should be given a script for EpiPen® and shown how to use the pen.

# Indication
- Patients who have had a systemic reaction to a sting.
- Patients with positive skin prick testing results to less than 1 mcg of insect venom.

# Contraindication
- Patients with severe cardiac disease such as recurrent ventricular tachycardia.
- Patients on β-blockers or patients on angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

# Equipment
-   Trolley
-   Disposable gloves
-   Kidney dish
-   Tuberculin syringes
-   Blue sheet
-   Alcohol wipes
-   IV cannula
-   1L normal saline
-   IV giving set
-   Tourniquet

# Medication

-   Venom kit/s (honey bee, paper wasp, yellow jacket)
-   Antihistamine
-   Hydrocortisone
-   Adrenaline
-   Ventolin nebuliser

> Must have access to a **resuscitation trolley**.

# Procedure

1.  Confirm the patient's identity by asking their full name and date of birth. Check the patients arm band and confirm the details match those on the venom kit/s from pharmacy.
2.  Explain the procedure to the patient and ensure appropriate consent is obtained and documented in the clinical notes.
3.  Obtain baseline vital observations: blood pressure, pulse, temperature, oxygen saturation, FEV. Patients with asthma should have peak flow readings before and after injections. If the peak flow drops below 75% of predicted value, no further injections should be given that day. Ensure that equipment for performing vital observations is working and available for use throughout the venom desensitisation procedure.
4.  Prior to performing desensitisation, patient must be reviewed by the doctor and an entry made in the clinical notes (consented, venom being used for desensitisation and schedule of testing, etc.).
5.  Ensure that the patient has venom doses and times charted appropriately on a medication chart, including resuscitation medications (antihistamines, adrenaline, Ventolin nebs and hydrocortisone).
6.  Venom dilutions prepared at the patient's bedside by the allergy nurse must be performed with the registrar/consultant; this includes preparation, checking doses and labelling dilutions accordingly.
7.  Administer subcutaneous doses of insect venom into the upper arm. Ensure that injections are given into the lower deltoid area, low enough to allow a tourniquet to be placed proximal to the injection site if an adverse reaction occurs. On each of the 4 separate occasions, each a week apart, variable doses in an escalating schedule are given. The lowest dose on each occasion is given first and the next highest dose is only given provided there have been no adverse events with the lowest dose.

-   Bee Venom/Paper Wasp/Yellow Jacket Desensitisation schedule for each of the four occasions are shown in the following table. **Injections are given 1 hour apart. Observe patient for 2 hours after the last injection.**

**Dosing Schedule (See Appendices)**

# Adverse Events

All adverse events are classified as either local or systemic. 

A **local** reaction is defined as redness and swelling at the injection site. 

All other adverse events should be considered as **systemic** (e.g. generalised rash or itch, wheezing, tachycardia, hypotension, hoarseness of voice, decreased level of consciousness).

All adverse events require treatment -- local reactions are treated by giving a non-sedating oral antihistamine -- fexofenadine (Telfast) 60mg; loratadine (Claratyne) 10mg; or cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10mg. Symptoms should begin to subside after 20 minutes and be settled before the dose is repeated one hour later.

> Systemic reactions are a medical emergency. Place a MET call, ring 2222, press emergency assist button at patient's bedside.
{.is-danger}

-   Once a systemic reaction has occurred, the procedure is terminated for the day and the patient is kept for observation for a minimum of 4 hours.
-   95% of all systemic reactions begin within 5 minutes of the injection. The doctor giving the dose should wait 10 minutes at the bedside.
-   Following completion of the 100mcg dose, patients are to receive monthly maintenance injections of 100mcg per injection for a minimum of 2 to 3 years. At the end of this period, the patient should have a skin prick test (SPT) repeated to demonstrate reduced sensitivity.

# Epinephrine Auto-Injector (EpiPen®) requirements:

-   Authority prescription for EpiPen®
-   EpiPen® trainer and education
-   Anaphylaxis action plan

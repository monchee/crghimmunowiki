To whom it may concern,

This is to confirm that the above patient commenced Honey Bee venom desensitisation, using a *Modified Rush Protocol* on 09/01/2020 and today reached his **maintenance dose of 100 micrograms**.

This dose is to be given **every 4 weeks**, for approximately the next 5 years.

When diluting the bee venom powder, please add 5.5ml of the saline diluent bottle. Please note that this bottle is a 9ml bottle, but only 5.5ml is required. This will give you a concentration of 100micrograms/ml.

The first injection from every new bottle, must be half of the maintenance dose and if there are no adverse events, the following month's injection should return to the normal maintenance dose.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

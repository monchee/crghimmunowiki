**PAPER WASP, YELLOW JACKET AND HONEY BEE**

-   Venom specific Immunoglobulin E (IgE) RAST Test
-   Baseline Serum Tryptase

# Skin Prick Test

| Histamine Positive Control | Diluent Negative Control |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1mcg/mL                    |                          |

> Positive on skin prick test inform Dr to review results and advise on further testing.
{.is-warning}

> Negative on skin prick test inform Dr then proceed to intra-dermal testing.
{.is-success}

# Intra-dermal Testing

Start Intra-dermal tests with the most diluted solution. If after 20 minutes no skin reaction is obtained continue the Intra-dermal testing using tenfold increments in the concentration until a reaction of 5-10mm wheal and 11-20mm erythema is obtained, or until a concentration of 1mcg/mL has been tested, whichever occurs first.

| Dose | Strength |
|---|---------------------------|
| 1 | 0.0001mcg/mL (1/10000) |
| 2 | 0.001mcg/mL (1/1000)   |
| 3 | 0.01mcg/mL (1/100)     |
| 4 | 0.1mcg/mL (1/10)       |
| 5 | 1.0mcg/mL              |

**ID 0.001mcg/mL → 0.01mcg/mL → 0.1mcg/mL → 1mcg/mL**

## Reconstitution
**Freeze dried venom (FDV) powder - 550mcg vial**
1. 550mcg (FDV) + 5.5mL HAS = 100mcg/mL
1. Draw up 0.2mL from the 100mcg/mL mother solution, add it to 1.8mL HAS = 10mcg/mL
1. Draw up 0.2mL from the 10mcg/mL, add it to 1.8mL HAS = 1mcg/mL
1. For 0.1mcg/mL, draw up 0.1mL from the 1mcg/mL vial
1. For 1.0mcg/mL, draw up 0.1mL from the 10mcg/mL vial
1. For 5.0mcg/mL, draw up 0.5mL from 10mcg/mL vial or 0.05mL from the 100mcg/mL solution
1. For 10mcg/mL, draw up 0.1mL from 100mcg/mL vial
1. For 20mcg/mL, draw up 0.2mL from 100mcg/mL vial

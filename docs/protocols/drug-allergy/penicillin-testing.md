# Background 

Penicillin allergy is a frequent cause of referral for Immunologist consultation and further testing. Testing and challenge strategies are complex, labour-intensive and carry a risk to the patient of reaction during the testing procedure or subsequent reactivity. Careful patient selection, clinical assessment and directed testing are thus essential. This protocol documents the recommended assessment and testing strategy as per recently published consensus guidelines.

Penicillin antibiotics belong to the beta lactam class of antibiotics and contain a beta lactam ring together with a variable side chain. All penicillins share the beta lactam ring, whereas the side chain uniquely identifies penicillins within the group.

IgE-mediated reactions to penicillin typically manifest with urticaria, angioedema, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, bronchospasm, hypotension or anaphylactic shock. In sensitised individuals, IgE can be directed against the beta lactam ring (which may cross-react with other beta lactam antibiotics such as cephalosporins), or the side chain. Sensitisation can occur at any time during exposure.

Delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to penicillin typically present with cutaneous features with or without systemic features, approximately 7-10 days after exposure to penicillin. DRESS, SJS, TEN and AGEP are all manifestations of cell-mediated reactivity. Assessment of IgE-mediated reactivity by skin and intradermal tests is not indicated in this group of patients due to a different clinical mechanism of reactivity. There is thus no validated clinical testing algorithm and oral challenge is contra-indicated to the risk of a recall reaction on re-exposure.

Allergy to penicillins is commonly reported in the community, with a frequency of up to 20% in hospitalised patients. A label of penicillin allergy leads to restriction of antibiotic prescription with a consequent increase in costs and prolongation of hospital admission.

Approximately 1-10% of patients with self-reported allergy will have evidence of Type I hypersensitivity on testing. Careful selection of patients for testing is essential, as 'delabelling' is associated with risks of reaction during testing and potential future re-sensitisation.

# Indications for Penicillin Allergy Testing

Penicillin allergy testing is expensive and time-consuming and adds clinical value in strictly limited circumstances.

To be eligible for testing, patients must have a clinical history of a hypersensitivity reaction to a penicillin consistent with an IgE-mediated process and meet at least one of the following indications.

Indications for penicillin allergy testing:

1.  Patients who have frequent infections with requirements for antibiotics several times per year.
2.  Patients who have a current infection for which penicillins are clinically superior to other alternative antibiotics.
3.  Patients who are allergic or intolerant to other antibiotics in addition to penicillin in whom the choice is narrowing.
4.  Patients with immunodeficiency, bronchiectasis or other risk factors for infections requiring antibiotic use.

The following groups of patients **do not** have an indication for penicillin allergy testing:

1.  Patients who have experienced symptoms consistent with IgM or IgG-mediated reactions. These patients should not receive penicillin again.
2.  Patients with a family history but no personal history of allergy to penicillin
3.  Patients with a history of a hypersensitivity reaction that is not typical of an IgE-mediated process
4.  Patients with a remote history of reactivity to an unspecified agent.
5.  Patients with a history of beta-lactam allergy who have subsequently tolerated the same penicillin

# Clinical Assessment

A consultant immunologist will assess patients referred for penicillin allergy. This assessment will include completion of the drug allergy questionnaire, adapted from the ASCIA Penicillin guidelines, to be filed in the medical records.

Clinical review and completion of the questionnaire will allow determination of the pre-test probability of penicillin allergy as either low, intermediate or high.

The clinical assessment and pre-test probability will determine if further testing is indicated by specific IgE, skin prick testing (SPT), intradermal testing (IDT) and/or oral challenge.

**Low Pre-Test Probability**

Patients are determined to have a low pre-test probability of penicillin allergy if the clinical features of the index reaction are not consistent with IgE-mediated penicillin allergy.

Patients with a low pre-test probability of penicillin allergy may proceed directly to graded oral challenge without prior specific IgE or skin testing.

If challenge results are positive, then patients to proceed to further testing as per Algorithm 1.

**Intermediate-High Pre-Test Probability**

Confirmation of allergy is important in this group as true penicillin allergy carries the risk of anaphylaxis. Patients are assigned intermediate risk if clinical features of the reaction cannot be recalled or if there is moderate clinical suspicion of an IgE-mediated index reaction.

Testing is performed by SPT/IDT followed by graded oral challenge if skin tests are negative. Positive testing to PPL/MDM/BP provides definitive evidence of penicillin allergy. Patients with selective positive sensitisation to aminopenicillins (amoxicillin and ampicillin) only may be considered for a penicillin challenge if indicated as per Algorithm 2.

**High Pre-test Probability**

Patients with high pre-test probability of penicillin allergy may not benefit from further testing.

The use of SPT/IDT and challenge must be assessed against the clinical need to confirm penicillin allergy, the risk of a reaction and the impact on clinical management. In certain cases, SPT and IDT may be used to find a safe alternate penicillin antibiotic in the case of possible sensitisation to the side chain rather than the beta lactam ring.

# Penicillin Specific IgE Testing

In vitro serum specific IgE (sIgE) testing is available for penicillin, amoxicillin and cefaclor and should be performed as a preliminary to skin testing. In the setting of a recent reaction consistent with IgE-mediated allergy, this test has relatively high specificity (97%-100%) but lower sensitivity (29%-68%). If penicillin sIgE tests are performed within three months of a systemic reaction, 30-50% are positive. Sensitivity is much lower when reactions are in the more distant past, and specificity is also lower when the pre-test probability of penicillin allergy is low.

# Skin Prick and Intradermal Testing Protocol

-   Skin prick and intradermal testing is performed as per ASCIA skin testing guidelines.
-   Testing is more likely to be positive if performed within 6-12 months of the reaction therefore testing should be delayed until at least 6 months have elapsed since the last clinical reaction.
-   Results to be recorded on template table and filed in patient's medical record.
-   Histamine is used as a positive control for skin tests and normal saline as a negative control for skin and intradermal testing.
-   The diluent used for testing reagents is sterile normal saline.
-   The minimum panel of reagents is:
-   Benzylpenicillin (BP)
-   Amoxicillin (AMX)
-   Culprit penicillin if available
-   Diater PPL (benzylpenicilloyl-poly-L-lysine)
-   Diater MDM (minor determinant mixture)
-   Supplementation with Ampicillin and Flucloxacillin is optional
-   Concentrations used must not exceed non-irritant concentrations as shown in Table 1.
-   Dilution is not necessary for SPT as the risk of anaphylaxis is very low. As IDT can be associated with systemic reactions, commencement at 1/10 - 1/100 dilutions is performed.
-   Skin and intradermal tests to be read at 20 minutes.

**Table 1: Non-irritating test concentrations for penicillin**

-   Perform SPT as follows:

| Reagent       | Solution     | Concentration |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Histamine     | Neat         | N/A           |
| Normal saline | Neat         | N/A           |
| Diater PPL    | Neat         | 0\.04mg/mL    |
| Diater MDM    | Neat         | 0\.5mg/mL     |
| AMX           | Neat         | 20mg/mL       |
| BP            | 10 000 IU/mL | 6mg/mL        |

-   If SPT all negative, perform 1^st^ IDT as follows:

| Reagent       | Solution | Concentration |
|---------------|----------|---------------|
| Normal saline | Neat     | N/A           |
| Diater PPL    | 1/10     | 0\.004mg/mL   |
| Diater MDM    | 1/100    | 0\.005mg/mL   |
| AMX           | 1/100    | 0\.2mg/mL     |
| BP            | 1/100    | 0\.06mg/mL    |

-   If 1^st^ IDT negative, perform 2^nd^ IDT as follows:

| Reagent    | Solution | Concentration |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| Diater PPL | Neat     | 0\.04mg/mL    |
| Diater MDM | 1/10     | 0\.05mg/mL    |
| AMX        | 1/10     | 2mg/mL        |
| BP         | 1/10     | 0\.6mg/mL     |


-   If 2^nd^ IDT negative, perform 3^rd^ IDT as follows:

| Reagent    | Solution | Concentration |
|------------|----------|---------------|
| Diater MDM | Neat     | 0\.5mg/mL     |
| AMX        | Neat     | 20mg/mL       |
| BP         | Neat     | 6mg/mL        |


-   If 3^rd^ IDT negative, proceed to oral challenge if indicated

# Graded Oral Challenge

-   Graded oral challenge is performed if skin and intradermal tests are negative to definitively exclude IgE-mediated allergy.
-   An intravenous cannula is to be inserted prior to the challenge.
-   Dose administration and monitoring to be recorded on challenge results template and filed in medical records.
-   The time interval between doses is 30 minutes.
-   Patients will be observed a minimum of two hours after the last dose.
-   Graded challenges can be performed as a 3-dose challenge (1/100, 1/10, full dose), 2-dose challenge (1/10, full dose) or single-dose challenge.
-   Amoxicillin is the preferred agent for oral challenge, particularly if the culprit penicillin is unknown. Oral challenge to Penicillin does not exclude amoxicillin allergy due to possible reactivity to the amoxicillin side chain. Challenge to amoxicillin assesses IgE directed against the beta lactam ring and side chain.
-   Graded oral challenge to amoxicillin syrup 250mg/5mL (obtained from pharmacy) is to be performed as follows:

| Dose number | Volume | Total Dose | Comments                            |
|-------------|--------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Dose 1      | 0\.1mL | 5mg        | 1st dose for 3\-dose challenge      |
| Dose 2      | 1mL    | 50mg       | 1st dose for 2\-dose challenge      |
| Dose 3      | 10mL   | 500mg      | 1st dose for single\-dose challenge |


-   If indicated, continue amoxicillin 250mg TDS for 3 days on discharge to evaluate for a delayed-onset reaction

# Follow up

-   On discharge, patients are advised of the risk of a late reaction and recommended to seek medical attention if this occurs.
-   Patients are advised to notify the Immunology nurse specialist on the next working day in the event of a delayed reaction
-   A letter dictating the results of skin testing and challenge will be sent to the referring doctor and patient's general practitioner.
-   Patients with positive skin tests or challenge should be seen in clinic at 6 weeks for further review and provision of Medic-alert information.

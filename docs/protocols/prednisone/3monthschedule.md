Based on EUVAS-CYCLOPS study - prednisone continued at 12.5mg daily to week 20, then reduced to 10mg daily until the end of month 12. From months 13-15 the dose was 7.5mg daily, and from months 16-18 reduced to 5mg daily. In this protocol initial doses for the first 8 weeks were based on body weight commencing 1mg/kg.

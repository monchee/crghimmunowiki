# Background

Allergen immunotherapy by subcutaneous (SC) injection is a proven method of achieving significant symptom reduction for certain IgE mediated allergic diseases. It is generally recommended when allergen avoidance and medical therapy have failed to achieve an adequate clinical response. These notes are based upon and should be read in conjunction with the Alutek product information.

Allergen immunotherapy with Alutek reagents is administered in two phases: **initial** and **maintenance**. The initial phase has several variants based on the sensitivity of the patient. The conventional approach is six weeks of weekly injections before monthly maintenance phase injections for 3-5 years. We will specify the intended treatment plan

**Alutek vials come in three different concentrations:**

1. Vial 0 contains 100 TU/mL.
2. Vial A contains 1000 TU/mL.
3. Vial B contains 10,000 TU/mL.

## Phase 1: Initial Phase
*see dosing guideline*

A conventional initial phase over six weeks omits vial 0. Vial 0 is reserved for very highly sensitised individuals or patients with unstable asthma for example.

## Phase 2: Maintenance phase 
*monthly for 3-5 years*

The second phase involves maintenance therapy with monthly injections, usually with a target dose of allergen of 0.5 mLs of Vial B, commencing one month after the final initial phase dose. The maximum tolerated dose (usually 0.5mL of Vial B) is then administered on a monthly basis for a period of three to five years.

# How to inject

Doses should be administered by SC injection via tuberculin syringe to the triceps region of the upper arm. Draw-back to avoid intravascular injection.

# Delayed doses

Doses may be delayed for a maximum of twice the intended dose interval without dose alteration. When the dose interval has exceeded twice the intended period, dose reduction will be required, resulting in an alteration of the overall dosing schedule in the treatment phase. Please contact the Allergy Nurse consultant for advice.

# When can a response be expected?

At three to six months into the maintenance phase (ie 6-9 months after first treatment dose) a clinical judgement needs to be made regarding response to immunotherapy. Immunotherapy should not be ceased without consultation in the clinic. This is because resumption of immunotherapy generally requires undertaking the initial phase again.

# Documentation of injections and outcome

Each patient should be supplied with a **Patient Treatment Log Book**. This should be kept up to date as a record of doses received. The booklet should remain in the patient&#39;s possession and should not be the only record of injections.

# Safety and adverse effects

Allergen immunotherapy is generally safe but may induce significant local or occasionally systemic reactions. In exceptional circumstances, deaths have been reported related to allergen immunotherapy. Most of these adverse events relate to incorrect administration of doses and unsatisfactory supervision of the patient following the administration of immunotherapy. For this reason protocols must be followed with great care.

**Subcutaneous Immunotherapy Code of Good Practice** 
Pre-injection checklist:

1. Check that the emergency kit is available: especially Adrenaline 1mg (1:1000) for IM use.
2. Check the patient&#39;s condition.
3. Check the allergen reagents.
4. Check instructions for administration of the injection.
5. Note the requirement for medical observation for at least 30 minutes after the injection.

The subcutaneous immunotherapy code of good practice also provides details of how to manage local reactions, bronchospasm or generalised reactions. All significant adverse effects should be discussed with the clinic.

# Special warnings and precautions

Allergen immunotherapy is more likely to be associated with clinically significant adverse reactions if the patient has unstable **asthma**, thus asthma control should be optimised prior to commencing immunotherapy. **ß-blockers** interfere with the action of adrenaline. Patients who receive immunotherapy should not receive ß-blockers. This may need to be done in consultation with the patient&#39;s cardiologist.

# How to manage new batches

New batches of allergens will be required during maintenance phase. Re-ordering should be anticipated well in advance of reagent expiry. Batches can be reordered through the supplier AMSL using the order form and contact numbers supplied. 

> The first injection from a new batch should always be administered at half the dose of the maintenance phase to ensure safety.

If this half dose is tolerated, the normal maintenance dose can be administered the following month.

> Dose adjustments are required for adverse reactions

# Adverse Reactions

## Local reactions

Some degree of local wheal and flare response is expected.

A local reaction (swelling, erythema, itchiness at the injection site) is considered significant if the maximum diameter of the erythema induration or swelling **exceeds 10cm** and this should be treated with an anti-histamine or topical cold compress. Supervision of the patient should be extended under this circumstance.

Local reactions exceeding 10cm should be managed by subsequent dose reduction, or can be prevented by pre-medication with a non-sedating anti-histamine taken at least 30 minutes prior to immunotherapy. Local reactions may also occur due to sensitivity to the aluminium hydroxide in the reagent which can result in delayed subcutaneous nodules in the skin.

## Immediate type systemic reactions

A systemic reaction involves anatomy other than the arm that received the injection. Systemic cutaneous or anaphylactic reactions must be treated on its merits. Hospital admission may be appropriate. Adrenaline is the cornerstone of management of anaphylaxis and should be administered intramuscularly.

In the event of a systemic reaction to immunotherapy the patient must be reviewed in the Immunology Clinic prior to further dosing.

## Delayed reactions

A serum sickness-type reaction can occur rarely with arthralgia, urticarial rashes, nausea, lymphadenopathy and fever. Immunotherapy should be discontinued in this case. Discuss with the clinic.

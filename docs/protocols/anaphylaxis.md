# Background

**Anaphylaxis** is an unpredictable and potentially life-threatening systemic allergic response that follows exposure to an environmental precipitant. Early diagnosis and appropriate medical management is essential. Unfortunately, anaphylaxis is often poorly managed. Key reasons for poor outcomes identified in systematic surveys include delayed diagnosis, delayed use of Adrenaline, inappropriate use of IV adrenaline and lack of adequate follow up.

The current protocol is based on published guidelines and practice parameters and aims to be a simple, easy-to-follow document for use by first responders in the medical setting.

# Evidence Base

No definitive clinical trials in anaphylaxis management are available. A number of consensus statements from relevant medical bodies have been published, most recently including a 2010 practice parameter update on the diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

Australian publications and guidelines have been referenced where possible.

# Recognition of Anaphylaxis

The diagnosis of anaphylaxis is not always clear. In cases with minimal urticaria or angioedema, or where bronchospasm or hypotension dominate in the absence of other characteristic features, the diagnosis may be delayed or missed.

Common clinical manifestations of anaphylaxis include:

-   Cutaneous
-   Flushing
-   Urticaria and angioedema
-   Pruritus
-   Respiratory
-   Dyspnea, wheeze
-   Upper airway angioedema and stridor
-   Rhinitis
-   Cardiovascular
-   Dizziness, syncope, hypotension
-   Miscellaneous
-   Confusion, incontinence

# Risk of Death

The following factors are associated with increased mortality in anaphylaxis:

-   Cardiorespiratory co-morbidities
-   Parenterally distributed allergen
-   Concurrent beta-blocker therapy
-   Delayed diagnosis
-   Delayed use of adrenaline
-   Older age
-   Prominent hypotension

# Common Precipitants of Anaphylaxis

-   Foods
-   Peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, eggs, cow's milk
-   Medications
-   Aspirin and NSAIDs, penicillin's and other antibiotics, muscle relaxants, anaesthetic agents
-   Other
-   Stinging insects, latex, exercise

# Management of Anaphylaxis

An algorithm for the recommended approach to the medical management of anaphylaxis is attached. Additional notes are as follows:

## Adrenaline

**Adrenaline** is the single most important therapeutic agent in the management of anaphylaxis and rapidly reverses all of the clinically significant manifestations.

The following points need emphasis:

1.  Adrenaline has a very short half-life of approximately 10 minutes and repeated dosing is frequently required.
2.  IM Adrenaline is very safe, with reported adverse events being extremely rare.
3.  The time to highest blood concentration is shorter when given IM into the vastus lateralis muscle (lateral thigh) than when given SC or IM into the deltoid muscle of the arm.
4.  Bolus IV Adrenaline for most cases is associated with unacceptable adverse effects including myocardial infarction, hypertension, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and severe psychomotor agitation. For patients *in extremis, *particularly with profound hypotension, an IV adrenaline infusion (titrated to response) can be commenced although requires intensive patient monitoring and senior physician/ED consultant/Intensivist involvement.

Obtaining IV access should not delay IM adrenaline administration.

Patients on mono-amine oxidase inhibitors may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of adrenaline and should receive reduced doses.

## H1 Antihistamines

Antihistamines address only the cutaneous manifestations of anaphylaxis and have no effect on cardiovascular or respiratory compromise.

Newer generation non-sedating antihistamines e.g. cetirizine are potent but may be poorly absorbed during anaphylaxis. For this reason, parenteral conventional agents such as promethazine (Phenergan) are often recommended although carry the risk of sedation and muscle necrosis.

## Fluid therapy

Vigorous fluid resuscitation (1-2 litres over the first hour) is important in all patients with hypotension. Consensus guidelines favour crystalloid over colloid in view of occasional systemic reactions to colloid preparations.

## Corticosteroids

Corticosteroids are slow acting agents of little benefit in the acute treatment of anaphylaxis but may prevent protracted or biphasic reactions. Corticosteroids are of particular importance in patients with pre-existing unstable asthma.

## Other measures

Nebulised β-adrenergic agonists such as salbutamol are beneficial for wheeze and bronchospasm.

Although there is little evidence to support their use, anti H2 receptor antagonists are often included in management guidelines as a supplement to anti H1 antihistamines.

# Grading of Severity of Anaphylaxis

A grading system of severity of generalized hypersensitivity reactions has been developed to aid the definition of reaction severity in clinical practice and assist with treatment decisions. At the discretion of the medical officer, IM adrenaline is indicated for reactions of minimum Brown Grade II.

## Brown Grading System of Severity in Generalised Hypersensitivity Reactions (Ref 1)

### I - Mild

Erythema, urticaria, non-airway threatening angioedema

### II - Moderate

Dyspnoea, stridor, wheeze, dizziness, vomiting, sweating, chest/throat tightness, abdominal pain

### III - Severe

Cyanosis OR SaO2 ≤ 92% OR SBP < 90mmHg OR confusion, collapse, incontinence

# Laboratory Tests

Serum for mast cell tryptase levels (5-10ml clotted blood, Immunology Laboratory) should be obtained between 1 and 6 hours following allergen exposure providing valuable confirmation of mast cell involvement.

Serum tryptase is of little benefit in the evaluation of anaphylaxis to food allergens.

# How long to observe?

Biphasic anaphylaxis occurs in 1-20% of episodes, and typically occurs within 10 hours after apparent resolution of the initial phase. Anaphylaxis-induced deaths have been reported in late phase reactions in individuals who have been effectively managed in the acute phase.

This appears to be most important in the following settings:

-   Delayed allergen absorption
-   Food-induced anaphylaxis
-   Asthmatics
-   Slow onset idiopathic anaphylaxis
-   History of prior biphasic reactions

In view of the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis, patients requiring Adrenaline who have any of the above risk factors should be observed for a minimum of 10 hours following resolution of symptoms. In most cases, this will necessitate overnight admission. All patients who have received Adrenaline should be observed for a minimum of 6 hours, and discharged into the care of a capable adult.

# Patients receiving Beta Blockers

Patients receiving β-blockers may be refractory to therapy and are likely to experience more severe anaphylactic reactions in view of blockade of endogenous compensatory adrenergic responses. These patients may benefit from more aggressive fluid resuscitation, and glucagon in view of its non-adrenergic inotropic effects. The β-blocker therapy should be withdrawn as appropriate and re-introduction considered at follow-up only after having considered alternative options.

# Epipen prescription and education

All patients requiring adrenaline should be discharged with an authority prescription for self-injectable adrenaline (Epipen) in the appropriate adult or paediatric dosage. An authority prescription may be obtained by ED Medical Officers. Verbal and written instructions regarding correct technique of Epipen use should accompany the prescription and can be downloaded from:

<http://www.allergy.org.au/images/stories/anaphylaxis/multinew/ENG.How_to_give_EpiPen_2011.pdf>

Prescription of an Epipen should be accompanied by a written action plan. This can be downloaded from the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) website below:

<http://www.allergy.org.au/health-professionals/anaphylaxis-resources/ascia-action-plan-for-anaphylaxis>

# Admission to Hospital

The on-call immunologist should be contacted if the patient has needed Adrenaline and admission is warranted. Patients admitted following suspected food-induced anaphylaxis require a low-allergen diet until further assessment.

# Immunology Follow up

All patients with anaphylaxis need to be reviewed in a specialist allergy facility for confirmation of the diagnosis, advice regarding allergen avoidance and provision of an anaphylaxis emergency action plan. Phone 9767 6735 during working hours for appointments.

# Notes on Paediatric Protocol for Anaphylaxis Management

The protocol for management of anaphylaxis in children follows the format of the adult protocol. Notable differences include the inclusion of weight-based dosing guidelines and transfer to Westmead Children's Hospital if admission is required.

Additionally, based on published paediatric life support guidelines, the administration of nebulised Adrenaline is included as an adjunctive measure in children with persistent stridor. It is emphasized that this is NOT a substitute for administration of IM Adrenaline for airway compromise.

# Summary

Anaphylactic reactions are unpredictable life threatening events occurring with increasing frequency in the general population. Duty of care management requires immediate assessment, prompt and appropriate use of IM adrenaline and supplemental therapies (see algorithm), careful observation and follow-up care. Bolus IV adrenaline is associated with significant side effects and should be reserved for patients *in extremis.*

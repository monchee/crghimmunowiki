# Modified Rush Protocol for Venom Immunotherapy

**Venom immunotherapy (VIT)**, is indicated for patients who have suffered a severe systemic allergic (anaphylactic) reaction following an insect sting and have had sensitivity confirmed by skin testing and/or venom specific IgE. VIT is available in NSW for honey bee (_Apis mellifera_), paper wasp (_Polistes_) and European wasp – also called yellow jacket (_Vespula germanica_) – collectively known as Hymenoptera Venom Immunotherapy.

# Aim

The aim of VIT is to reduce the risk of life threatening reaction to further stings in persons with a previous systemic reaction, and demonstrated venom-specific IgE-mediated sensitisation.

# Background

Hypersensitivity to insect stings are potentially life threatening. Since the potential for severe systemic reactions exists in the use of these products, the Hymenoptera venom preparations should be used

1. by doctors experienced in administering immunotherapy
2. under the guidance of a specialist Immunologist,
3. only where adequate means for treating systemic reactions are immediately available.
4. The patient should be fully informed of possible benefits and risks and should be closely observed.

Before testing or treatment of patients with these products the doctor should be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of use of these products including indications, risks, contraindications and treatment of adverse reactions. Severe local or systemic reactions to venom administration can occur immediately (within one hour) or as delayed reactions. Patients should be kept under direct observation for a minimum of 30 minutes following skin testing and/or therapeutic injections, and should be instructed to contact the doctor promptly if symptoms of an allergic reaction or shock occur.

# Specific issues

## Anaphylaxis plan

Patients should be instructed in the use of, and have available, an emergency anaphylaxis kit for self administration of adrenaline.

## Route of administration

Injections are subcutaneous and not intradermal or intravenous. Specific steps should be employed to prevent inadvertent IV administration

## Venom dilutions

An error in dilution of venom and labelling of reagents are common causes of ADR in VIT.

## Premedication

Pre-treatment with the H1 antihistamine terfenadine reduced VIT reactions (local and systemic) in randomized controlled trials. Routine anti-H1 premedication is recommended, although this may mask some features of systemic reactions.

## Baseline tryptase

Baseline tryptase level correlate with the risk of systemic reactions during VIT. Elevated levels may indicate an underlying hyperplastic mast cell disorders

## Batch to batch variation

New batches of venom require dose adjustment for initial safety in maintenance phase

## Dosing protocols

A variety of dosing protocols are used in different clinics. The terms rush and ultrarush have different meanings by different authors. Unless otherwise required, standard dosing strategies should follow the package insert. The &quot;Table2 – modified rush protocol&quot; in Up-to-date is a suitable protocol, and is used as the basis of the dosing strategy described below.

A maintenance dose of 100 micrograms is chosen in most protocols and represents approximately twice the venom content of a standard honey-bee sting. This dose will not always be tolerated and may require individual patient adjustment. In one study a maintenance dose of 100 micrograms protected 96-100% of subjects on challenge, whereas a dose of 50 micrograms protected 79% of subjects.

## Interval between maintenance injections

Maintenance doses should be given at 4 weekly intervals for the first year. Various practice parameters allow for extending the interval to 6 weeks and even 8 weeks in subsequent years. Intervals of longer than 3 months between injections are not considered reliably protective.

## Local reactions to VIT

Occur in 50% of adults usually at doses of 20-30 micrograms. Local reactions are bothersome rather than dangerous, and do not predict future systemic reactions. Local reactions in most cases should not lead to adjustment of the treatment protocol as they generally do not persist with higher doses: &quot;treat through&quot;. Cold packs can be useful.

## Systemic reactions to VIT

Systemic reactions occur in 3-12% of cases, the majority being mild and easily treated. Premedication with anti-H1 agents reduces this risk, and high baseline serum tryptase levels and unstable asthma increase this risk - See above. Systemic reactions are more likely to occur in the dose escalation phase.

## Dose adjustment after a systemic reaction

Return in 1 week and administer half the implicated dose under anti-H1 premedication

## Measures of efficacy

There are no satisfactory tools to assess efficacy other than tolerance of insect stings in the field. Insect sting challenges are not used because they are impractical and lack standardisation. Venom specific IgG is used in some units but may not be available. Venom skin tests are not to be used as these may remain positive.

## Duration of therapy

The majority of patients will receive maintenance injections for a period of 5 years. Indefinite VIT is recommended for life threatening reactions where there is ongoing risk of sting exposure.

## Dosing Schedule

Injections 1, 2 and 3 are given at 30 minute intervals on days when more than one injection is administered. During weeks 1 through 3, the patient receives 3 injections per visit. During weeks 4 through 8, the patient receives two injections per visit. Maintenance is achieved by approximately week 8. Thereafter, the patient receives one injection per visit and the interval between visits is extended from weekly to monthly.

Injections 1, 2, and 3 are given at 30 minute intervals on days when more than one injection is administered (reading from left to right across table in the week 1 row). During weeks 1 through 3, the patient receives three injections per visit. During weeks 4 through 8, the patient receives two injections per visit. Maintenance is achieved by approximately week 8. Thereafter, the patient receives one injection per visit and the interval between visits is extended from weekly to monthly. This schedule is based upon the package insert for ALK-Abello venom extracts (Round Rock, TX).

# Brown Grading System
**Grading of Severity of Anaphylaxis**

A grading system of severity of generalized hypersensitivity reactions has been developed to aid the definition of reaction severity in clinical practice and assist with treatment decisions. At the discretion of the medical officer,

IM adrenaline is indicated for reactions of minimum Brown Grade II.

Brown Grading System of Severity in Generalised Hypersensitivity Reactions (Ref 1)

## I – Mild

Erythema, urticaria, non-airway threatening angioedema

## II - Moderate

Dyspnoea, stridor, wheeze, dizziness, vomiting, sweating, chest/throat tightness, abdominal pain

## III – Severe

Cyanosis OR SaO2 ≤ 92% OR SBP \&lt; 90mmHg OR confusion, collapse, incontinence

# Anaphylaxis

Brown Grade II or III - see below

- ABC + Adrenaline
- 0.5mg IM (0.5mL x 1:1000) q5-15mins into lateral thigh

**Other measures:**
1.Antihistamine: Cetirizine 10mg OR Phenergan 25mg IM/SLOW IV
2.Hydrocortisone: 200mg IV q6h
3.Salbutamol : nebulised 2.5-5mg
4.Ranitidine: 50mg SLOW IV
5.Glucagon: If on beta-blockers, 1-2mg IM/SLOW IV, infusion 10μg/min

## Anaphylaxis: Adult

### Brown Grade
**I – Mild** Skin manifestations, non-airway angioedema

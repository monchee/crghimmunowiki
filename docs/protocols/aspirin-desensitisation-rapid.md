# Background

**Aspirin** has been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in management of coronary artery disease with indications both in the acute and chronic setting. Aspirin is also the cornerstone of dual antiplatelet therapy which reduces the risk of stent thrombosis following coronary artery intervention.

Desensitisation involves the administration of escalating doses of drug with the aim of inducing a temporary state of tolerance. Aspirin desensitisation protocols have been shown to have a high rate of efficacy and safety in patients with cardiac disease[^1].

The rapid desensitisation protocol requires a minimum of 6 escalating doses with close patient monitoring. Desensitisation can occur via the rapid protocol in patients who require ongoing low dose aspirin who have a history of mucocutaneous reactivity to aspirin or other non AERD reactivity. Desensitisation is contraindicated in patients with a history of delayed hypersensitivity or severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR).

> Patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) or features of Samter's triad require desensitisation using the slow (3-day) protocol. The rapid desensitisation protocol is contraindicated in these patients and can lead to severe respiratory reactions.

Following successful desensitisation, daily exposure to a minimum of 81mg is required to maintain tolerance[^2]. An interruption in dosing of >24 hours will result in the risk of a clinical reaction and patients will require a repeat desensitisation procedure prior to further aspirin therapy.

# Checklist for Aspirin Desensitisation

- [ ] Obtain prescription for soluble aspirin and take to pharmacy with proposed date of desensitisation.  
- [ ] Doctor to chart aspirin doses as well as the following resuscitation medications on medication chart:
	-   Adrenaline 0.3mg IMI
	-   Hydrocortisone 100mg IV bolus
	-   Salbutamol 5mg nebulised
	-   Cetirizine 10mg oral
  {.grid-list}
- [ ] Collect Aspirin from pharmacy on the day of desensitisation.
- [ ] Patient is free of antihistamines for 4 days prior to testing and is aware of the need to spend at least 5 hours under observation.
- [ ] Patient is clinically well.
- [ ] Informed written consent obtained
- [ ] IV Cannula inserted
- [ ] Prepare resuscitation medications and IV normal saline for infusion. Check oxygen and suction outlets are working.

# Aspirin Desensitisation Protocol: Rapid

Aspirin deteriorates very rapidly in aqueous solutions to form acetic and salicylic acid. Therefore, it is very important that **a fresh solution is prepared every 30 minutes**.  Any solutions that exhibit a vinegary smell should be discarded and a fresh solution prepared.
- [ ] Check baseline HR, BP, Sa02 and FEV1 prior to commencement of desensitisation.
- [ ] Check and document HR, BP and SaO2 5 minutes after each dose. If patient is asthmatic or has respiratory disease, measure FEV1 after each dose. Otherwise FEV1 can be measured pre and post desensitisation.

Dissolve HALF a soluble Aspirin tablet (150mg) in 150mL of water to prepare a 1mg/mL solution.

> Aspirin doses are administered as per the following published protocol.[^3][^4]

| 2    | 20            | 0\.3        | 0.3mL of 1mg/mL
| #    | Discard and prepare fresh **1mg/mL** solution             | repeat        | |

| #    | Discard aspirin solution             | administer 1 aspirin tablet        | |
| 9    | 160           | 100         | 1 tablet

> Monitor heart rate, blood pressure, peak expiratory flow rate and clinical status prior to each dose.

The final dose can be administered as a 100mg enteric coated tablet.

# Aim
**Aspirin desensitisation** is indicated in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Symptoms will often be suboptimally controlled on inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids and/or Leukotriene-modifying agents as salicylate sensitivity may play a pathogenic role. The aim of aspirin desensitisation is to safely commence aspirin with graded introduction performed under supervision and monitoring of respiratory function with a view to induction of tolerance to aspirin with repeated ingestion.

The protocol is to be performed on an outpatient basis in the Respiratory Function Laboratory on at least 4 consecutive days. Admission for the first 24 hours of the procedure may be required for high risk patients as the critical day for reactions is Day 1 of the protocol. [^1]

> Desensitisation is contraindicated in patients who have experienced severe life-threatening reactions to aspirin.

# Target dose 
300mg daily (efficacious for nasal polyposis[^4]) although this may vary individually with doses up to 650mg BD[^2]. Doses of 325mg BD and 650mg BD have been shown to be fairly equivalent in clinical efficacy although some patients may require the higher of the doses[^2].

# Abbreviations used

**AERD** = aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease

# Candidates for aspirin desensitisation [^7]

1. Patients with AERD with no concomitant respiratory diseases but with moderate-severe asthma, intractable nasal congestion, or both, if they have failed to respond to topical corticosteroids and a Leukotriene-modifying agent.
2. Patients with AERD whose concomitant respiratory diseases are also being treated but have failed to respond to treatment including topical corticosteroids and Leukotriene-modifying agents.
3. Patients with AERD who are multiple nasal polyp formers.
4. Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids for control of AERD.
5. Patients with AERD who require aspirin for other diseases
6. Checklist to be completed prior to Commencement of Desensitisation protocol**

- [ ] Patient is fully informed of risks, benefits, implications and limitations of aspirin desensitization. This includes awareness of the need for regular therapy and the need for a repeat desensitisation procedure if dosing interrupted for >48 hours.
- [ ] Gastro-intestinal risks of long-term aspirin need to be considered and discussed with the patient. Prophylactic PPI therapy is to be prescribed for the duration of long-term aspirin therapy.
- [ ] Patient clinically well with no acute illnesses
- [ ] Patient is not taking beta blockers
- [ ] Patient is not taking antihistamine-containing medications for the last 48 hours  as these can mask a naso-ocular reaction

  - Use of Leukotriene inhibitors, inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting -agonist therapy as necessary[^5]
  - Patient should be on Leukotriene inhibitor if tolerated
- [ ] Continue regular medications (excluding the above-mentioned excluded medications) including Leukotriene inhibitors

- [ ] IV Cannula to be inserted on a daily basis

- [ ] Confirmation of negative pregnancy test in females

- [ ] Equipment available for respiratory monitoring and resuscitation

- [ ] Salbutamol nebulizer prepared and ready for use

- [ ] Dedicated staff member available throughout procedure in high-risk patients

- [ ] Low-risk patients – medical staff available to attend to patient if required

# Medication Guidelines

- **Cetirizine po**
Dose: 10mg
 - **Prednisolone po**
 Dose: 1mg/Kg to max 50mg
 - **Hydrocortisone IV**
 Dose: 100-200mg
 - **Adrenaline IM**
 Dose: 0.01mg/kg of 1: 1000 to max 0.5mg, repeat q10mins if necessary

 Dose: Nebulised ampoule
 - **Ranitidine IV**
 Dose: 50mg

> Oral antihistamine, corticosteroids, salbutamol inhaler and IM Adrenaline (1:1000) must be available. These medications are standing orders and do not need to be ordered by a medical officer prior to administration.

# Protocol

## Day 0

Baseline lung function performed and FEV1 repeated every hour for 3 hours to confirm optimal lung function and assess diurnal variation[^5]. Confirm variability of less than 10%[^5].

- [ ] Review checklist

> Administration of graded oral aspirin begins from Day 1
{.is-info}

Doses to be administered at 3 hour intervals1 with monitoring of spirometry and BP at 30-minute intervals for the first hour and then hourly or earlier if development of symptoms. Patients to be regularly assessed for symptoms of a clinical reaction including urticaria, angioedema and naso-ocular reactions. Patient to remain monitored and observed for at least 3 hours following the last dose.

## Day 1

- [ ] Patient admitted and checklist reviewed

| Number |   | Dose |
|--------|---|------|
| Dose 1 |   | 30mg |
| Dose 2 |   | 45mg |
| Dose 3 |   | 60mg |

Patient observed for 3 hours following last dose and then discharged if stable

## Day 2

| Number |   | Dose |
|--------|---|------|
| Dose 1 |   | 60mg |
| Dose 2 |   | 100mg |
| Dose 3 |   | 150mg |

Patient observed for 3 hours following last dose and then discharged if stable

## Day 3

| Number |   | Dose |
|--------|---|------|
| Dose 1 |   | 150mg |
| Dose 2 |   | 200mg |
| Dose 3 |   | 300mg |

Patient discharged and maintained on long-term 300mg daily dose

## Day 4
*(if higher maintenance long-term dose indicated)*

| Number |   | Dose |
|--------|---|------|
| Dose 1 |   | 300mg |
| Dose 2 |   | 600mg |


Patient discharged and maintained on long-term doses up to 600mg BD

# Aspirin preparation 
Dispersible aspirin 300mg tablets to be used

Enteric coated aspirin not advised during desensitisation process due to delay in absorption after oral dosing.

## Procedure

Dissolve 300mg aspirin tablet in 300mL water to make a concentration of 1mg/mL

Fresh preparation to be made for each dose due to instability of aspirin in solution.

Administer doses in mL as per the following:

- 30mg = 30mL of 1mg/mL solution
- 45mg = 45mL of 1mg/mL solution
- 60mg = 60mL of 1mg/mL solution
- 100mg = 100mL of 1mg/mL solution
- 150mg = 150mL of 1mg/mL solution
- 200mg = 200mL of 1mg/mL solution
- 300mg = 300mL of 1mg/mL solution
{.grid-list}

# Additional Notes

The previous dose is to be repeated if a reaction occurs, after recovery to baseline FEV1. Continue this dose at 3-hourly intervals until no signs of a positive reaction are observed. When the provoking dose is tolerated without reaction, dose escalation may continue as per the protocol[^5].

If nasal, gastrointestinal or cutaneous reactions occur on Day 1, pre-treat with H1 and H2 blocker for remainder of challenge sequence.

Aspirin desensitization is to be discontinued in the event of anaphylaxis during the procedure.

Patients at low or moderate risk of reaction can start at a higher dose of aspirin of 40 or 60mg rather than 30mg if pre-treated with a Leukotriene inhibitor[^3].

High risk patients should start at a lower dose of 20 or 30 mgand commence a Leukotriene inhibitor prior to the challenge[^3].

Note: discontinuation of drug for 48 hours leads to loss of tolerance and the desensitization procedure needs to be repeated[^1]. A minimum of 81mg/day is required to maintain the desensitized state[^1].

# Positive Reaction

- Decrease in FEV1 by ≥ 20% from baseline value, bronchoconstriction, wheeze
- Naso-ocular symptoms – rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, ocular tearing and injection, peri-orbital swelling or erythema
- Hypotension (documented systolic BP \&lt; 90mmHg in adults)

### Risk of adverse reaction associated with:

- Non-use of Leukotriene inhibitors3
- Baseline FEV1 \&lt;80% predicted3
- History of ED presentations for asthma3
- 75% of reactions occur after 45 and 60mg doses, 3% after 150 or 325mg doses and none after a 650mg dose3

## Management of a Positive Reaction

- **Isolated respiratory symptoms** – Salbutamol nebulizer. May need to be repeated as aspirin-induced reactions can last several hours.
- **Laryngeal symptoms** – nebulised or intramuscular Adrenaline
- **Gastro-intestinal cramping** – intravenous ranitidine
- **Isolated Hypotension** – intramuscular Adrenaline
- **Naso-ocular symptoms** – oral antihistamines
- **Urticaria or angioedema** – oral or parenteral antihistamine

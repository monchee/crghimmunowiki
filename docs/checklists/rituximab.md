# Obtaining Rituximab approval
Three different approaches

1. **On-label PBS applications** -- see PBS rules

2. **Off-label Drug Committee applications** for all conditions other than NMOSD and MG require *Individual patient use (IPU) approval letter to the Drug Committee* PLUS additional *Roche Compassionate access application* PLUS *SAS Category B application*
3. **NMO and MG** -- authorised prescriber status -- see [prescribing rituximab for NMO and MG](/rituximab/offlabel-nmo-and-mg). Complete *Rituximab prescribing declaration for NMOSD and MG* PLUS *Roche Compassionate access application* PLUS *SAS Category B application*. IPU approval letter is not required

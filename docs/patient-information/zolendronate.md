# What is Zoledronate?

**Zoledronate** is a member of a family of medicines called bisphosphonates. This class of medicines has been a great advance in preventing a common side effect of corticosteroid (prednisone) therapy called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a loss of the mineral content of bone that occurs slowly over time, causing no symptoms until such time as the bones are vulnerable to fracture from minimal trauma. Some assessment of your risk of osteoporosis can be made by considering the total amount of steroid exposure, and by measuring your bone strength with simple bone mineral density (BMD) tests. We now know that it is essential to prevent bone loss before it occurs in patients who require steroid therapy for inflammatory diseases.

Before you begin treatment with Zoledronate, you should talk about the risks and benefits.

# Am I eligible to receive Zolendronate?

You have been prescribed Zolendronate because you qualify under the PBS criteria as listed below:

-   You have been or will be on long term steroids (at least 3 months)
-   You are taking at least 7.5mg per day of prednisone or equivalent
-   You have a bone mineral density T score of -- 1.5 or less

# How do I take Zoledronate?

Zoledronate is administered by a single intravenous (IV) infusion once a year. The infusion itself, will take approximately 15-30 minutes.

You will be given an authority script and can arrange to collect your medication from any community retail pharmacy.  An appointment date and time will be arranged for you to have the infusion in the Haematology Ambulatory Care Unit (HACU) which is located on the ground floor of the main building at Concord Hospital.

**Make sure you drink enough fluids before and after the treatment.** Two glasses of water before and after the infusion are usually enough. This will help to prevent dehydration. You may eat normally on the day you are treated with Aclasta.

# **Dental check**

Dental assessment and treatment should be completed before commencing Zolendronate. Your dentist should be informed that bisphosphonate therapy is planned. Maintain good oral hygiene.  You may need to take an antibiotic if you need a dental procedure. See information on [osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)](/patient-info/onj) below.

# Arrangements for future doses

Follow-up bone mineral density (BMD) scan will be required one year later and a decision made about further doses. Current PBS criteria allow up to a maximum of 3 annual doses.

# Calcium and Vitamin D

You should also receive daily calcium (1000mg) and Vitamin D supplements (400-1000 IU), unless there is a particular reason why this is not suitable in your case. Calcium and Vitamin D provide essential support for bone health, but are not sufficient to protect you from bone loss while on steroid therapy.

# Pregnancy and Breast feeding

In the absence of adequate available experience in human pregnancy, Zoledronate should not be used during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. 

# Blood tests

You should have a blood test to check kidney function and mineral levels in your blood in the month following the infusion.

# Side Effects of Zoledronate

Like all medicines, Zoledronate may cause side effects. In most patients it is very well tolerated.

-   **Infusion related side effects**

These are not uncommon and include flu-like symptoms, allergic symptoms, upset stomach and fatigue.

-   **Disturbance of calcium levels**

This will be checked after the infusion and replacement minerals provided if necessary.

-   **Dental problems**             

High dose bisphosphonate therapy has been associated with a very rare severe side effect affecting the teeth and jaw known as [osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)](/patient-info/onj). The risk of ONJ is less than 1 case in 100,000 patient-treatment-years. Known risk factors for ONJ include: high dose therapy (10-20x the dose used in osteoporosis), diagnosis of cancer, simultaneous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene and preexisting dental disease (e.g. infection of the gums/jaws).

> Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your doctor.

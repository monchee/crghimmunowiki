# What is SLE?

SLE is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various parts of the body. It is an autoimmune condition, meaning that the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, leading to pain, swelling and organ damage. Once diagnosed, SLE tends to be a lifelong condition with periods of disease flares in which symptoms worsen followed by periods of remission. SLE can vary in severity from a mild skin rash to serious disease with organ damage. Treatments are available which reduce symptoms, modify the disease course, treat inflammation and minimize organ damage.

# What causes SLE?

The cause of SLE is not clear. Individuals who develop SLE likely do so because of a combination of genetic risk combined with exposure to a particular trigger such as an infection, UV exposure or pregnancy. The condition is much more common in females of childbearing age.

# What are the symptoms of SLE?

> SLE affects different patients differently. We have included information about common features of SLE but most patients will not be affected by all these things.

Symptoms of SLE are caused by inflammation which can affect the whole body or certain organs. Whole body **"systemic" symptoms** include fatigue, fever, loss of appetite or weight loss.

Specific organ symptoms vary with the organ affected and are as follows.

- **Joint pain and stiffness** are very common and are often the earliest symptom of SLE. Affected joints can be swollen and tender and typically include the fingers, wrists and knees.
- **Skin rashes** are very common, particularly a 'butterfly' rash that appears as redness over the cheeks and nose after sun exposure. Hair thinning, dryness of the mouth and eyes, and mouth ulcers are also common.
- Almost all patients with SLE are '**photosensitive'** in that they may develop a rash after exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun or fluorescent lights. These individuals should use a sunscreen with a high protection factor daily and follow other measures to minimise UV exposure.
- **Raynaud's phenomenon** is a frequent problem in SLE and causes blood vessels in the fingers and toes to constrict in response to cold temperatures and other triggers. Decreased blood flow causes the fingers or toes to become pale, then bluish then reddish. This can be painful but most often is not damaging to the tissues in SLE.
- SLE can cause inflammation in the **kidneys** known as lupus nephritis. Patients with SLE need close monitoring of kidney function with urine and blood tests. If untreated, lupus nephritis can cause permanent scarring in the kidneys. If kidney disease is suspected, a biopsy may be performed to determine the nature and severity of the inflammation and will be used to guide treatment decisions.
- SLE can cause inflammation of the lining of the **lungs** ('pleurisy') or **heart** ('pericarditis'). Symptoms include chest pain or shortness of breath and often respond to anti-inflammatory therapy.
- Involvement of the **nervous system** by SLE causes symptoms of headaches, seizures, depression or pain/numbness in the hands and feet. Additional tests such as CT or MRI scans may be performed if this is suspected.
- A subgroup of patients with SLE may have additional autoantibodies that increase the risk of **blood clots** or pregnancy complications. Your doctor will advise you if these antibodies are detected and any treatment that may be required.

# How is SLE diagnosed?

SLE is diagnosed based on the presence of characteristic clinical findings in combination with the detection of autoantibodies on blood tests. Once the condition is diagnosed, further tests may be arranged to determine the extent of organ involvement which varies from patient to patient. Treatment decisions will be based on the nature and severity of organs involved.

# What are the treatment options?

Although there is no cure for SLE, a number of treatment options are very effective at controlling symptoms, limiting organ damage, reducing flares and improving quality of life.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) eg Nurofen, Celebrex, Mobic, are helpful in reducing joint pain caused by inflammation. These medications can cause stomach discomfort or even ulcers and should be taken with food.

Hydroxychloroquine, "Plaquenil", is an antimalarial medication that has been found to have benefit in addressing joint pains, skin rash and fatigue in patients with SLE. It may also have a disease modifying effect and reduce the risk of disease flares.

Corticosteroids, such as Prednisone, may be used either alone or in combination with other medications that suppress the immune system. As corticosteroids have potentially serious side effects, their use is reserved for patients with more significant inflammation. The development of side effects can be reduced by keeping the dose as low as possible.

A number of immunosuppressive medications are available to treat more serious manifestations of SLE such as involvement of the kidneys or nervous system. Your doctor will discuss these further with you if required.

# What about Pregnancy?

Women with SLE are frequently able to carry a pregnancy to term and deliver a healthy baby. SLE does not usually affect the ability to fall pregnant. The best method of contraception needs to be discussed and some contraceptives may affect risk of blood clots. You should avoid becoming pregnant during a disease flare due to the high risk of complications to yourself and the fetus.

If you wish to become pregnant, you should discuss this well in advance with your doctor as certain medications may need to be stopped before an intended pregnancy. Some patients with SLE have a higher risk of pregnancy complications or miscarriage due to the presence of certain antibodies, and may require specific treatment during pregnancy to minimise the risk. Your doctor will advise you further if this applies to you.

# How will SLE affect my life?

SLE can cause a wide spectrum of disease ranging from a mild illness to a severe debilitating condition with organ damage. Survival rates have improved dramatically over recent decades due to improvements in treatments available. Many patients enter long periods of disease-free remission.

If you have SLE, it is important that you attend for regular medical appointments for monitoring of your condition as well as blood and urine tests. The frequency of this will be dictated by your clinical progress.

It is also important to attend your GP regularly, keep up to date with vaccinations and inform any doctors you see of your diagnosis and list of medications.

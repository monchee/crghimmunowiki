# What is latex?

Latex is a naturally occurring rubber product sourced from the sap-like fluid of the commercial rubber tree *Hevea brasiliensis*. The manufacturing process involves treatment at high temperatures as well as the addition of chemicals to increase strength and durability. Sometimes a powder lubricant such as cornstarch is added to decrease the stickiness of the rubber surface. Allergic reactions can occur to latex proteins, or to the added chemicals. Powder particles containing latex molecules can become airborne and cause allergic symptoms in the airways.

# What types of allergic reactions occur to latex?

A number of different clinical reactions of variable severity can occur in response to latex.

**Immediate allergic reactions** are the most serious, and result in itching, redness and hives (urticaria) soon after direct contact with latex. Inhalation of airborne latex particles can cause hayfever or asthma-like symptoms. Anaphylaxis is the most serious allergic reaction to latex and can occur following exposure to latex in medical and non-medical settings.

**Irritant Dermatitis** is the most common adverse reaction to latex and causes a dry, itchy or scaly rash. Symptoms are not mediated by the immune system and are worsened by sweating and chafing under latex gloves or frequent hand washing.

**Contact Dermatitis** causes a similar rash however is caused by an immune reaction to latex. Symptoms occur 1-4 days after exposure to latex, most often on the hands after wearing gloves. Prolonged exposure can result in dryness and thickening of the skin.

Skin damage associated with both types of latex dermatitis increases the risk of developing latex sensitization and immediate allergic reactions as described above.

# Who is at risk of latex allergy?

The main risk factors for latex allergy are occupational exposure or a history of allergic diseases. Occupations in which latex gloves are commonly used include health care workers, food handlers, domestic workers and hairdressers. Patients with spina bifida or other individuals who require frequent urinary catheters are also at risk of developing latex allergy.

Some latex proteins are present in certain foods such as banana, kiwi, avocado and chestnut, and individuals with a history of reactions to these foods are more likely to be allergic to latex.

# How is latex allergy diagnosed?

The diagnosis of latex allergy is based on a careful history of typical symptoms occurring after exposure to latex. Confirmation of sensitization is done by demonstration of positive skin prick or blood tests to latex allergen, although these tests will be negative in patients with irritant or contact dermatitis. Patch testing may be performed to confirm contact allergic dermatitis.

# How do I manage latex allergy?

-   If you are allergic to latex, you should avoid latex in all its forms.
-   As contraceptive condoms and diaphragms contain latex, these should be avoided and latex-free substitutes used.
-   You should advise doctors and dentists of your allergy well before any planned procedures, so these can be arranged in a latex free environment.
-   Use non-latex gloves eg vinyl and consider carrying your own supply to use in an emergency.
-   Be wary of takeaway food which may be handled by workers wearing latex gloves.
-   Your doctor may provide you with a Medicalert identification device stating your allergy if you are at risk of anaphylaxis on exposure to latex.

If your job requires you to wear gloves, you should use latex free gloves and request that non-powdered latex gloves are used by others in your work environment. You should promptly treat any hand dermatitis as an intact skin barrier reduces the risk of developing latex allergy.

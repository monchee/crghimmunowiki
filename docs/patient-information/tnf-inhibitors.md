# What are TNF inhibitors?

**TNF inhibitors** belong to a class of medicines called biological disease modifying drugs. These medicines block naturally occurring molecules in the immune system called cytokines. Certain cytokines are found in excessive amounts in people with inflammatory diseases and are responsible for promoting the disease process. TNF inhibitors offer a targeted strategy of disease control by blocking the cytokine Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) which contributes to inflammation. Examples include Infliximab, Etanercept and Adalimumab. TNF inhibitors are not given orally and are administered by subcutaneous injection at a variable frequency. Infliximab is given as an intravenous infusion.

# Risks

> Your doctor will discuss possible side effects and risks with you before commencing treatment.

As TNF inhibitors affect the immune system, mild infections, particularly of the upper respiratory tract may occur more frequently than usual. Serious bacterial infections such as pneumonia can also occur. Some patients experience injection site or infusion reactions. Infusion reactions to Infliximab are more common with the first or second infusion and can be reduced by giving pre-medication before treatment.

Sometimes patients treated with TNF Inhibitors can develop blocking antibodies which reduce the effectiveness of the medication. This can be reduced by giving TNF inhibitors in combination with other medications which suppress the immune system.

Other less common risks of TNF Inhibitors include the following:

1.  Patients who have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB) are at risk of developing serious TB infection with TNF inhibitor therapy. Because of this risk, screening for TB exposure is necessary prior to treatment.
2.  TNF Inhibitors can rarely induce side effects involving the nerves, such as inflammation of the nerve to the eye causing changes in vision.
3.  TNF inhibitors have been rarely associated with the development of autoimmune conditions, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
4.  TNF Inhibitors should be avoided in patients with heart failure or multiple sclerosis as they can cause worsening of these conditions.

It is important to be aware that many of these side effects improve or disappear when TNF Inhibitor treatment is stopped.

# Precautions

> **Blood tests** will be required during your treatment to monitor your condition and to determine the effectiveness of treatment.

If you have an **active infection** of any kind, treatment with a TNF inhibitor will not be given until the infection is treated successfully. If you are receiving treatment with a TNF inhibitor and develop symptoms that could be due to an infection, it is important to seek medical attention early and alert your doctor to your full list of medications.

**Screening tests**:  the following tests will be conducted before commencing treatment with a TNF inhibitor:

-   Blood tests for hepatitis B and C and HIV
-   Chest x-ray and a blood test to detect exposure to TB. If inactive TB is detected, then preventative treatment for TB will be commenced.

**Vaccines**: If you are being treated with a TNF inhibitor you should not receive 'live' vaccines such as MMR, polio, BCG or yellow fever. Talk with your doctor before receiving any vaccines.

Pneumovax and the yearly influenza vaccination are safe and recommended to reduce your risk of those infections.

The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer appears to be increased in patients who receive TNF inhibitors and **skin cancer prevention** measures including yearly skin checks are recommended.

If you require **surgery**, your TNF inhibitor will likely be stopped before surgery. It will be restarted again after the operation, at a time determined by your surgeon and immunologist.

# Pregnancy

Not enough is known regarding the risks of TNF Inhibitors in pregnancy. If you plan to become pregnant, it is important to discuss this with your doctor, as each case is different.

You should not breastfeed while taking TNF Inhibitors.

# When do I stop treatment?

If TNF Inhibitor treatment is stopped for more than a few weeks there is a risk that your condition will worsen. Continue with your treatment unless advised by your doctor or unless side effects develop.

# Terms

-   **Gammaglobulin** and **Immunoglobulin** are terms used to describe antibodies, which are vital proteins produced by the immune system to deal with infections.
-   **IgG, IgA, IgM** - types of immunoglobulins
-   **Plasma** is the liquid part of blood that remains when all cells have been removed
-   **Immunodeficiency** is a term used to describe patients who have a component of their immune system that is missing or functioning poorly. Typically patients with antibody deficiency have low levels of immunoglobulins in their blood tests.

# Why is Immunoglobulin therapy used?

Many people with immunodeficiencies have insufficient antibodies to adequately fight infections.

Immunoglobulin replacement therapy is one of the most important and successful therapies in these cases and can be life saving. Immunoglobulin replacement therapy can:

1.  Treat existing infections
2.  Prevent new infections from occurring
3.  Prevent the long-term damage of chronic infections (for example bronchiectasis in the lung).

# How is Immunoglobulin therapy made?

Immunoglobulin products are purified from pooled plasma of many healthy blood donors. When donors give blood samples, the red cells and plasma are separated. The plasma is pooled together and processed in highly specialised and regulated facilities to produce the product. Each preparation therefore contains a wide variety of antibodies. Immunoglobulin products available in Australia include Intragam P®, Octagam® and Kiovig®

# How is it administered?

There are two common ways that immunoglobulin replacement therapy can be delivered; intravenous (into the vein) and subcutaneous (under the skin).

1.  **Intravenous injections** -- at present intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is the most common means of immunoglobulin replacement therapy in Australia, New Zealand. Infusions are delivered directly into the vein, usually in a hospital day-stay clinic or sometimes in the patient's home. The infusion takes approximately two to four hours. The dose and frequency vary, and depend on the person's weight and immunoglobulin levels. Most people receive doses once every 4 weeks.
2.  **Subcutaneous injections** -- the last few years has seen a move toward subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) injections, especially throughout Europe. This involves slowly infusing the antibody preparation directly under the skin, which can be done at home. This is usually done once or more each week. Unfortunately Australian governments do not currently fund SCIG treatment. This may change in the coming years.

# Side Effects

Immunoglobulin replacement therapies are normally very well tolerated and serious side effects are rare. There are some side effects that you need to be aware of:

## Risk of blood-borne infections

As immunoglobulin preparations are derived from blood donors, there will always be a theoretical risk of blood borne infections. There has never been a case of HIV transmitted by this means. However, in the past, there have been cases of transmission of Hepatitis C and other viral illnesses overseas. Transmission of Hepatitis C has not occurred in Australia or New Zealand.

Current preventative measures have been greatly enhanced so that the risk of infection from antibody therapy is now close to zero. Nevertheless, you may wish to discuss this risk with your medical team.

## Other side effects

Some patients get minor side effects such as low-grade fevers or headaches which can usually be reduced by a slower infusion rate or treated with paracetamol. Occasionally patients experience hives or wheezing or rarely severe headaches. Rare cases of severe allergic-type reactions and abnormal kidney function have been described.

## Blood clots

In recent years Octagam was withdrawn from use because of a small increase in the frequency of blood clots in recipients of this products. Octagam has returned to the market after manufacturing improvements. Blood clots remain a risk with all IVIg products but this risk is very small.

## IgA reactions

Very rare cases of allergy like reactions have been reported with IVIg products in the past and in a strictly limited number of sensitized patients. These reactions are much less likely with modern IVIg products.

You should notify your doctor of any side effects you might experience.

# Limitations

Antibody preparations contain essentially only one of the important components of the immune system's response to infection. This therapy does not cure the antibody deficiency, and will seldom reverse long-term organ injury from chronic infections. For this reason it is best to start before organ damage has occurred.

# Availability

Product shortages that have occurred in Australia in the past, but the supply chain is now more secure through the introduction of imported products. "National Criteria for the Clinical Use of IVIg in Australia" must be met before funded IVIg products can be prescribed (further reading [www.nba.gov.au](http://www.nba.gov.au/) ) The Department of Immunology at Concord Hospital has played a leading role in the development of these Criteria.

**Is it important to receive an Australian product?**

Both Australian and imported IVIg products meet international standards in safety and quality. There is no evidence that a product from a particular country is more or less effective once these standards have been met.

# Requirements of National Blood Authority (NBA) for provision of Immunoglobulin Replacement

From **November 2014**, the NBA has requested the ongoing monitoring and review of you, the patient, and of which you will need to provide consent to the following items:

-   Personal information and clinical data been collected. This will be recorded in a secure database held by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service
-   De-sensitised data been gathered, reported and disclosed by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service to the National Blood Authority. This will assist with product supply monitoring and planning and for quality and research purposes to improve treatment programs
-   De-sensitised data been reported and disclosed by the National Blood Authority to state and territory health departments and a combined report of the de-sensitised data been published on an annual basis on the NBA website
-   Consent to treatment
-   In the event that you do not demonstrate clinical benefit, the treatment will be ceased.

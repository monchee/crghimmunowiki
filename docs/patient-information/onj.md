# What are bisphosphonates?

Bisphosphonates are medications that treat osteoporosis: they work by blocking bone-resorbing cells, reducing bone loss and decreasing the risk of fractures.

In Australia, Fosamax^®^, Actonel^®^, Pamisol^®^, Aclasta, and Zometa^®^ are the most frequently used bisphosphonates. They are prescribed for treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and certain cancers affecting bones.

Bisphosphonates are generally very well tolerated. The most frequent side effect is heartburn and gastrointestinal discomfort. Recently, a rare complication of high-dose bisphosphonate treatment has been observed. This condition is called **Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)**.

# What is ONJ?

The typical features of ONJ include jaw pain, numbness, soft-tissue swelling, local gum infection, loosening of teeth, drainage, and exposure of bone in the mouth. These symptoms may occur spontaneously, or, more commonly, at the site of a previous tooth extraction. This may occur months or even years after starting therapy with bisphosphonates.

# How great is the risk of this happening?

The risk of ONJ is very small. Worldwide, the cumulative reporting rate of osteonecrosis of the jaw is considered to be less then 1 case in 100,000 patient-treatment-years.

# Who is at risk?

More then 95% of all cases of ONJ have been seen in cancer patients receiving comparatively high doses of intra-venous bisphosphonates (usually 10 to 20 times the dose used in osteoporosis). Conversely, only a few cases have been observed in patients with osteoporosis on standard doses of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates. 

# Known risk factors

1.  diagnosis of cancer
2.  simultaneous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids
3.  poor oral hygiene
4.  pre-existing dental disease (e.g. infection of the gums/ jaws)

# What can I do to prevent ONJ?

1.  Inform your dentist that you are taking bisphosphonate therapy
2.  Maintain good oral hygiene
3.  Report any dental symptoms to your doctor and dentist

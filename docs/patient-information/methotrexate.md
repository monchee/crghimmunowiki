# What is Methotrexate?

Your illness is an inflammatory condition of the immune system. Methotrexate helps interfere with the cells of the immune system that generate inflammation. Methotrexate has proved a great success in many patients, and often enables a reduction in steroid doses. Since other body cells may also be affected by methotrexate, side effects may also occur. For this reason, methotrexate is only recommended when the likely benefits of treatment outweigh side effects that may occur. Before you begin treatment with methotrexate, you should talk about the risks and benefits.

# How fast does it work?

Methotrexate may take some weeks to have its full benefit. Other medications may be required to achieve control of your illness in the meantime. Unfortunately, methotrexate is not a cure for most inflammatory illnesses.

# How do I take Methotrexate?

Methotrexate is taken in a single dose **ONE DAY PER WEEK ONLY**. If it is mistakenly taken every day it can be very dangerous. You should chose the day of the week you wish to take methotrexate (eg Sunday) and you should stick to that day.

The B group vitamin **Folic Acid** ("folate") is used with methotrexate and reduces certain side effects. It is typically taken in a dose of 5mg on the day following Methotrexate day.

# Blood tests

> Regular blood tests are essential for the safe use of this medication, even if recent results have been entirely normal. Please make sure that you are clear about the schedule of blood tests required.

# Pregnancy and Breast feeding

> Methotrexate is NOT safe in pregnancy and breast feeding.
{.is-danger}

There is a good chance that this medicine may cause birth defects if either the male or female is taking it at the time of conception or if it is taken during pregnancy. It is best to use effective contraception while you are taking methotrexate and for 6 months after it has stopped. You need to tell your doctor if you think you might become pregnant while taking methotrexate.  This medicine does not prevent your ability to parent children in the future.

# Other medicines

Do not take any prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine without informing your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking methotrexate.  Many different medicines can interact with methotrexate in a way that may cause harm.

# Use of Alcohol

> Methotrexate and alcohol can combine to injure the liver. 
{.is-warning}


If you choose to drink alcohol you need to be sure that the quantities are safe -- follow national guidelines ([alcohol.gov.au](http://www.alcohol.gov.au/)). No more than two standard drinks on any day reduces your risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury over a lifetime.

# Missed dose and overdose

If you miss a dose of this medicine, go back to your regular dosing schedule and check with your doctor. Do not take a double dose next time. If you think you might have overdosed, please check with your doctor promptly.

# Storage and safe handling

Keep out of reach of children. Wash hands after handling tablets. Other people should wear disposable gloves when handling methotrexate tablets. Pregnant women should not handle the drug at all.  Unused tablets should be taken to the pharmacy for disposal.

# Immunisations

Certain vaccines need to be used with caution in people on methotrexate. 
> Do not have any immunisations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval.

# Side Effects of Methotrexate

Methotrexate is usually very well tolerated. Do not be alarmed by the list of side effects. The main side effects are:

- **Nausea and vomiting**. Folic acid supplements and taking methotrexate with food might help. If you are experiencing too much nausea, the dose may need to be altered or another medication chosen instead.
- **Mouth ulcers**. Again folic acid may help.
- **Sun sensitivity**. Avoid too much sun and solariums until you see how you react to the sun, especially if you tend to burn easily. Use sunscreen and cover up.
- **New cough or shortness of breath**. Lung side effects are very rare, but should be reported to your doctor as soon as possible.
- **Increased risk of infections**. The immune system is required to fight infections. By dampening down immune responses, the risk of infections might be greater. Any fever (temperature over 37.5°C) or infection must be reviewed by your medical team. Keep a thermometer at home.
- **Liver effects**. Methotrexate can cause changes in liver tests. Heavy alcohol consumption can trigger this side effect.
- **Reversible hair thinning**. This medicine may cause a temporary loss of hair in some people. After treatment with methotrexate has ended, normal hair growth should return.

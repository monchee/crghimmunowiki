# Testing Information

You have been referred to our service for antibiotic allergy testing. Adverse reactions from antibiotics are common but only about 5% of these are due to a true drug allergy. It is important to determine if the reaction you have experienced was a true drug allergy so that you will not be incorrectly denied access to this antibiotic in the future.

It is also important to correctly diagnose you as penicillin allergic, if you are to be protect against serious adverse events and even death, if you were to be given this class of antibiotic again.

Investigation of antibiotic allergy involves a sequence of tests starting with a blood test (RAST - Radio Allergo Sorbent Testing) and proceeding to skin prick and intradermal (injection under the skin) testing and in some cases oral challenges. Your participation in this testing is voluntary and if you wish, you can stop the testing at any stage.

# Blood Test (RAST)

Approximately 10mL of blood will need to be collected. This blood test involves laboratory testing for drug allergy. Unfortunately the current RAST tests available only detect a proportion of patients who are antibiotic allergic due to the limited range of antibiotic products available for testing. However if you are shown to be allergic to penicillin by the RAST test you will not need to proceed to other tests explained below. You will be given a medic-alert pamphlet and information on what antibiotics are dangerous and what antibiotics are safe for you.

# Skin Testing

Allergy skin testing involves the placement of the drug on your skin or an injection under your skin (intradermal testing). The reagents used to test for antibiotic allergy depends on what drug you reacted to and what agents are available in soluble form. Currently in Australia some of these products required to test for drug allergy are not approved medications by the Commonwealth of Australia Testing Authority -- The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Your doctor has been given special permission to use an imported product (from Spain) which is licensed in Europe and has been shown to be effective and safe to test for penicillin drug allergy. However, before this product can be used on you, you have to give written consent acknowledging that you have been informed that the product is not an approved TGA drug but has been approved for restricted use in determining penicillin allergy.

This testing will take approximately 4-6 hours. You will need to stop antihistamine drugs for one week prior to testing. You must tell your doctor if you are taking any medications for your heart (for example b-blockers) or steroids. Skin prick testing involves the placement of a drop of reagent on the skin of your forearm and than pricking with a small lancet.

If you are allergic a red flare and raised wheal reaction will occur within 10-15 minutes. The reaction is like a mosquito bite and may be itchy. More severe reactions are uncommon but include wide spread skin rash (hives), asthma attack, generalised itch and discomfort. It is important to alert the staff testing you if you experience any of these symptoms. If the skin prick test is positive allergy is likely and you will be given a medi-alert pamphlet and a list of drugs that are to be avoided and safe alternatives.

If no reaction occurs you will proceed to intradermal testing involving the injection of 0.01-0.02 ml of solution under the skin of the forearm. This procedure does produce a sharp pain for a minute or so. If you are allergic to the drug you will develop a raised itchy lesion at the site of the injection in 10- 15 minutes. As above, if you are allergic you will be given a medi-alert pamphlet and a list of drugs to be avoided and safe alternatives.

There is a 1% chance of having an adverse reaction from skin testing.

# Oral or Intravenous Challenge

If you are negative on all of the above tests and your doctor considers that you still may be allergic to an antibiotic, you will be offered an oral or IV drug challenge. This procedure has more risk of an adverse event than the above procedures and will require admission to hospital, as a day-stay patient. The chance of a significant reaction on oral or IV challenge is between 1 and 5%.

The drug is given orally or intravenously in increasing doses with half an hour in between doses, so that if a reaction develops, it is recognised at a low dose. An intravenous cannula is inserted prior to testing as a safety measure.

If you experience no problems with the drug challenge then you can be safely given those antibiotics in the future. Conversely if you experience an adverse event you will be given a medi-alert pamphlet and a list of drugs to be avoided and safe alternatives.

The information obtained from testing will be recorded in your medical records and your referring doctor (often general practitioner) will be informed of your test results. In addition we advise you to purchase a medi-alert device to alert medical staff as to your allergy in the future.

If you experience any adverse events from the skin testing with the Spanish products, the TGA and the Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee -- CRGH  will need to be informed.

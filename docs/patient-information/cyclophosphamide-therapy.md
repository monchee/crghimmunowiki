Here is some information that will help you understand Cyclophosphamide treatment for your illness.  The medications you take are your choice. Please feel free to discuss any aspect of this information.

# What is Cyclophosphamide?

Cyclophosphamide is a powerful medication that suppresses the immune system.  It is very effective in the treatment of diseases that are due to an overactive immune system, including inflammatory diseases such as vasculitis, and autoimmune conditions such as SLE. Cyclophosphamide is only recommended in cases where the illness is very serious and benefits of therapy are considered to out-weigh the risks of treatment.

In many cases, cyclophosphamide may effectively settle the illness for long periods *after *the treatment has stopped ('remission').  Other therapies may not be able to achieve remission in your condition.

Cyclophosphamide belongs to a class of drugs that are used in cancer chemotherapy called cytotoxic agents. Your condition is not a form of cancer, and the doses we use are lower than standard cancer treatments. Special nursing precautions are required however, and you may be treated in cancer areas of the Hospital for this reason.

# How is Cyclophosphamide used?

Cyclophosphamide may be taken by one of two methods

-   By **injection** into vein - IV
-   **Orally** - once a day

IV therapy is considered less toxic than tablets taken by mouth.

It is usually used with steroids (methylprednisolone injections or prednisone by mouth). Typically, treatment would continue for 6 months or less, depending on how well your condition is controlled.

# What are the side-effects?

Cyclophosphamide may be associated with serious side effects in some but not all people.  Side effects are usually related to the total dose used, and the treatment plan has been

developed with careful attention to reducing the risks.  Understanding these side effects may prevent them occurring, and to manage them if they occur.

1.  **Infection**. Cyclophosphamide increases the risk of infections that wound normally not occur in someone with an intact immune system.  Some of these are infections may be prevented by taking cotrimoxazole (also known as Bactrim).  You should obtain a thermometer and inform your doctor immediately if you develop chills or fevers >38°C.

2.  **Bone marrow suppression**. The bone marrow is the organ of the body that makes red blood cells (which carry oxygen), white blood cell (which fight infection), and platelets (which help the blood clot). ***Careful monitoring of blood counts is essential during the Cyclophosphamide therapy.*** You will be asked to have frequent blood tests.  Suppression of the bone marrow by Cyclophosphamide is usually transient.

3.  **Tumours**. Patients who receive long-term Cyclophosphamide therapy at high doses appear to be at an increased risk of bone marrow and bladder tumours. The risk with short-term (less than 6 months) treatment is likely to be much lower.  Patients who have been treated with Cyclophosphamide tablets need to be followed indefinitely for the possibility of bladder complications of the treatment.  The best method of screening for this complication is to check the dipstick test of the urine.

4.  **Other bladder problems**. Cyclophosphamide may cause bleeding from the bladder, a complication known as "haemorrhagic cystitis". This can be avoided by using Cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and by flushing the Cyclophosphamide out of the bladder by drinking plenty of water or other fluid.

5.  **Infertility**. Cyclophosphamide may cause infertility in both men and women. Once again, the risk of infertility appears to be related to the cumulative dose. A woman's age may also affect her risk of infertility, with the occurrence of early menopause higher in women over the age of 30 at the time treatment is begun.  You may wish to discuss the assistance with storage of sperm or eggs.

6.  **Other side-effects**. Reversible hair thinning (hair will grow back when treatment is completed). Significant hair loss if unusual at standard doses. Some patient describe nausea and vomiting, sores in the mouth, darkening of the fingernails and skin rash.

# Whom do I contact if I need advice

-   **During the day:** Please call 9767 5000 and ask to speak to the Immunology nurse. You can also visit your GP.
-   **After hours:** Please call 9767 5000 and ask to speak to the Immunologist on-call.
-   **If you have fevers more than 38°C:** Please attend the Emergency Department at Concord Hospital as soon as possible, day or night.

# What should I do if I am taking Cyclophosphamide?

-   Take the medicines carefully as instructed
-   Make sure blood tests are drawn as requested to monitor your blood count
-   Inform your Doctor if you are pregnant, or if you plan to have children in future. Both men and women should use reliable birth control methods while on Cyclophosphamide, and for at least 6 months after stopping.
-   Drink 2-3 litres of fluid a day to keep up the brisk urine output, and empty you bladder before sleep at night. This will help flush the medication out of the bladder.  This applies to the day of treatment only for those receiving IV therapy.
-   Inform your Doctor immediately if you develop fevers or chills.
-   Seek advice before vaccinations

# Special Instructions

> Precautions to be taken while on chemotherapy and safe handling of body fluids
{.is-warning}

Cyclophosphamide is transported via your blood stream to all parts of your body and mainly excreted in your urine.  Safe handling of body fluids protects you and your family from unwanted exposure.  

For seven days after your last dose:

-   Flush the toilet on full flush with the lid down after you have used it.
-   Keep a bowl or plastic bag handy just in case you feel sick. If you use a bowl for vomiting, this must not be used for anything else and be disposed of when you finish you chemotherapy treatment.
-   Clothing or bed linen that is soiled with urine, bowel motions and vomit should be handled with 2 pairs of disposable gloves and washes separately from other items in a hot or cold wash at the maximum cycle, then line dry.
-   If you have somebody at home helping you they should wear 2 pairs of disposable gloves when handling body fluids.
-   Incontinence pads, ostomy and catheter bags should be disposed of safely. Waste should be disposed of into sealed plastic bag, then into household rubbish or into a cytotoxic bin and returned to your community health care worker or treating hospital.
-   If you are sexually active you or your partner should wear condoms. This is because low amounts of chemotherapy may be passed in your semen or vaginal secretions.

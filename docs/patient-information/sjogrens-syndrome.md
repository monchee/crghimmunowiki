# What is Sjögren's syndrome? 

**Sjögren's syndrome** is an autoimmune disease that causes dry eyes, dry mouth, and other symptoms. It happens when the immune system attacks glands that keep the eyes, mouth, and other parts of the body moist.

Some people with Sjögren's syndrome have other immune system conditions. These include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and scleroderma.

# Symptoms

The main symptoms are dry eyes and dry mouth -- these are called "sicca" symptoms.  Sjogren's syndrome is just one of a number of causes of dry eyes and mouth.

Sjögren's syndrome can also affect other parts of the body. Symptoms can include:

-   Dry, itchy skin
-   Joint or muscle pain
-   Urinary symptoms such as needing to urinate more often than usual, at night, or sudden urges to urinate
-   Tiredness
-   Vaginal dryness
-   Dry cough

# Treatment

Currently, there is no cure for Sjögren's syndrome. Although the symptoms of dryness are likely to be lifelong, Sjögren's by itself in most cases is not life-threatening. However, a number of treatments may improve symptoms and are listed below. Many of these are available without needing a prescription. Immunosuppressive medications may be considered if there are serious internal organ manifestations.

# Management

-   Avoid medications that dehydrate or have side effects of dryness -- ask your doctors to review your medications.
-   Avoid caffeine and alcohol, which dehydrate the body.
-   Avoid air-conditioned environments or excessive heating.
-   Avoid outdoor activities on dry windy days

## Dry eyes

To relieve the symptoms of dry eyes, some options are:

-   Eye ointments and artificial tears. If you are sensitive to the preservatives in eye drops, an authority prescription for larger quantities of preservative-free single-use drops can be obtained (eg Viscotears, Cellufresh, Systane Unit Dose).
-   A procedure called "punctal occlusion" -- In this procedure, an ophthalmologist puts tiny plugs in the tubes that normally drain tears from the eye. This can help with dry eyes by keeping tears on the eye longer.
-   'Moisture chambers' -- an attachment for glasses to reduce evaporative loss from the eyes.

## Dry mouth

Saliva is important for preventing dental decay. Therefore, special attention to dental hygiene is required to prevent accelerated dental decay in Sjögren's syndrome.

To prevent dental decay and gum disease with Sjögren's syndrome, it is recommended that you:

-   See the dentist at least 6 monthly
-   Avoid sweet, sugary and/or acidic drinks (e.g. fizzy drinks, juices, flavoured water) and snacks
-   Brush and floss the teeth after every meal
-   Use a toothpaste containing fluoride
-   Discuss use of fluoride mouth rinses with your dentist
-   Remove dental prostheses at night
-   Recognise the early signs of tooth decay and seek dental treatment early.

To relieve the symptoms of mouth dryness, you can

-   Chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free lozenges
-   Use saliva replacement e.g. Aquae, Biotene
-   Moisten the mouth with water (e.g. rinse and spit)
-   Apply lip balm
-   Occasionally medication is used to stimulate saliva production

## Dry nose

-   Saline nasal sprays or drops e.g. Fess nasal spray, Narium nasal spray or nasal drops, Physiomer nasal spray, Sterimar nasal spray
-   Nasal moisturizer (e.g. Fess nasal gel, Nozoil nasal drops)

# Other symptoms

-   Skin dryness -- use moisturizing lotions for sensitive skin types
-   If vaginal dryness is a problem, consider use of moisturisers and/or vaginal oestrogen. Water based lubricant gels such as KY can be used to make intercourse less uncomfortable.
-   Tiredness -- maintain a gentle regular exercise program, modify activities and rest frequently
-   Muscle and joint pain -- may require anti-inflammatory medication -- discuss this with your doctor.
-   Consider fish-oil supplementation

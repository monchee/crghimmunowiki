# Urticaria

Urticaria is raised red itchy areas of the skin. About 20% of people have hives at some time during their lives. "Chronic urticaria" is much less common, and is diagnosed when itching occurs on a daily basis for 6 weeks or more.

Urticaria develops when there is a reaction that activates immune cells called mast cells in the skin. When activated, these cells release natural chemicals including histamine, which causes localised itching, redness, and swelling of the skin. In most cases, urticaria lesions appear suddenly and disappear within several hours. Itching is usually the most bothersome symptom of hives, and it may be severe enough to interfere with work and sleep.

# Angioedema 

Angioedema (soft tissue swelling) also develops in about half of patients with urticaria. Angioedema symptoms include puffiness of the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, abdomen, feet, and genitalia.

# Anaphylaxis

Less often urticaria can occur as part of a more serious allergic reaction called [anaphylaxis](/patient-info/anaphylaxis). You need to be able to recognize anaphylaxis and respond promptly if this occurs. Your doctor will discuss this with you if necessary in your case. Symptoms might include:

-   Rapidly evolving severe allergic symptoms
-   Trouble breathing
-   Tightness in the throat
-   Lightheadedness or passing out

# Types of Urticaria

 Urticaria can be:

-   **Acute** (brief)
-   **Chronic** (long-standing -- daily symptoms for more than 6 weeks)
-   **Physical** (triggered by certain types of physical stimulation, such as heat, cold, or sun exposure)

## Acute urticaria 

Most cases of hives are acute and will not last beyond a few days to a week or two. Triggers of acute hives can include the following:

-   **Infections** --- Infections can cause hives in some people especially children. The hives usually persist for a week or two and then disappear.
-   **Drugs and complementary medicines** --- many types of drugs can trigger urticaria. All conventional, complementary and alternative medicines will need to be reviewed.
-   **Insect stings** --- Stings from certain insects (bees, wasps, ants) can cause hives.
-   **Food allergies** --- Food allergy can cause acute hives which typically appear within 30 minutes of eating the food. The foods most likely to cause hives in children include milk, eggs, peanuts, other nuts, soy, and wheat. The foods most likely to cause hives in adults include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and other nuts.
-   **Intolerance to food additives and natural food chemicals** --- great care is taken by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand to maintain the quality of the foods we eat. However, some people develop sensitivity to natural or added food chemicals. This is not a simple allergy and can be difficult to sort out. The Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Allergy Unit has a specialist interest in this field, and useful information is available from their website under "Food Intolerance"
-   **Contact urticaria** --- Hives can occur after you touch certain substances if you are allergic to them eg latex, plants, or animal saliva.
-   **Unexplained** --- failure to identify an underlying cause is common in studies of patients at specialist allergy units

## Chronic urticaria 

Chronic urticaria may look similar to acute urticaria, but is a different condition -- it is rarely caused by simple allergy, and this fact can be difficult for patients to accept. Symptoms occur daily and last longer than six weeks, sometimes for years. Chronic hives can be frustrating because they come and go and can interfere with sleep, work, or school. Chronic urticaria is rarely permanent; almost half of people are hive free within one year. Chronic urticaria can be an autoimmune condition. In some cases, chronic urticaria may be due to an underlying systemic condition such as problems with thyroid function. Your doctor may organize certain blood tests to investigate this possibility.

## Physical urticaria 

Hives can be triggered by a variety of physical factors:

-   Exposure to cold
-   Changes in body temperature or sweating
-   Vibration
-   Pressure
-   Exercise
-   Sunlight or water
-   Dermatographism (literally "skin writing"). People with this condition develop reddened, raised lines if the skin is stroked firmly or scratched.

Physical forms of hives tend to be long lasting and are considered a type of chronic hives.

# Treatment of Chronic Urticaria
Although there is no cure, hives usually respond well to treatment.

## Avoid triggers 

In chronic urticaria, simple triggers in the environment are generally not found. This is because the problem arises from inside the body. In the past it has been common to recommend a strict elimination diet in chronic urticaria, but evidence of benefit is not proven and harm from a restricted diet may occur. You may wish to discuss dietary approaches further.

## Antihistamines 

Antihistamines are medicines that can relieve itching. Most people with hives respond to antihistamines. You may need a relatively high dose or more than one type of antihistamine to control your symptoms.

There are three main types of antihistamines. They differ in side effects, cost, how long the medicine lasts, and need for a prescription.

-   **Older anti-H1 antihistamines** --- Older antihistamines start to work quickly and work well to relieve symptoms. Problems with older anti-histamines are the need for frequent dosing and side effects of drowsiness or sleepiness. These medicines are therefore not recommended for people who plan to drive or operate heavy machinery. Examples include: 

		Phenergan and Polaramine.

-   **Newer anti-H1 antihistamines** --- Newer antihistamines have fewer side effects than older antihistamines. Also, newer antihistamines have to be taken less often, usually once or twice per day. Examples include:

		Levocetirizine (Xyzal) 5-20mg daily
		Cetirizine (Zyrtec) 10-20mg daily
		Fexofenadine (Telfast) 180mg-360mg daily
		Loratadine (Claratyne) 10-20mg daily

-   **Anti-H2 antihistamines** --- There is another type of antihistamine, commonly used to treat indigestion. These may be added to anti-H1 antihistamines for additional benefit. Examples include: 

		Ranitidine 150mg twice daily.

## Other medicines used in chronic urticaria

A range of other medicines are sometimes used for breakthrough urticaria and include the following. These are reserved for particularly resistant cases and are generally not required for most patients:

-   **Doxepin** 10-25mg nocte increasing to 100mg as tolerated
-   **Montelukast** 10mg daily
-   **Nifedipine** 10mg up to 20mg tds
-   **Rupatadine** 10mg (not readily available in Australia)
-   **Oral steroid** therapy
-   **Cyclosporin**

# How to use antihistamines in chronic urticaria

The aim of therapy is ***daily symptom control*** until the hives resolve of their own accord. This may take months or even years. Once the right antihistamine has been identified for you it is important to take them every day whether you feel itchy or not. 

Many people are understandably reluctant to take a regular medication. However, these medications have an excellent long term safety profile and are much less effective in treating urticaria that is already underway. By taking a daily antihistamine it is usually possible to completely suppress the problem so that life can continue as usual. 

It is common to recommend a treatment break from antihistamines one day per month until the hives return. When they recur, antihistamines are recommenced on a daily basis until the next month.

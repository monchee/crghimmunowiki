# What is Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil)?

Your illness is an inflammatory condition of the immune system. Hydroxychloroquine was originally developed to treat malaria, but also works by a variety of mechanisms to change the way the immune system responds -- in particular it has an important effect in controlling lupus and lupus-like responses. 

The benefits in lupus include controlling fatigue, skin and joint symptoms, and by stopping lupus becoming more aggressive over time (preventing "flares"). It is not considered to be an immunosuppressant. Before you begin treatment with Hydroxychloroquine, we should talk about risks and benefits.

# How fast does it work?

Hydroxychloroquine may take some weeks to have its full benefit. Unfortunately, hydroxychloroquine is seldom a cure. Hydroxychloroquine may be given with other drugs such as corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) which also suppress your immune system, and may provide more rapid symptom relief.

# How do I take Hydroxychloroquine?

Hydroxychloroquine comes in 200mg tablet sizes, with the usual dose being 1-2 tablets a day, depending on your weight. Doses are preferably taken with food. We will adjust the doses according to your response, any side effects you experience, and how your blood tests change.

# Blood tests

**Regular blood tests are used for the safe use of this medication and to monitor the progress of your illness. Please make sure that you are clear about the schedule of blood tests required.**

# Pregnancy and Breast feeding

**Hydroxychloroquine is a** Category D drug for pregnancy, which means that it may be expected to cause malformations or irreversible damage to an unborn baby. Clinical experience suggests that this rating may not be correct, with many pregnancies progressing safely with continued use. Recent guidelines for use in rheumatic diseases recommend the continuation of hydroxychloroquine during pregnancy if indicated, and compatibility with breastfeeding. Please inform your medical team if you are planning a pregnancy or if you become pregnant while taking hydroxychloroquine.

# Missed dose and overdose?

It is important to take the correct dose. If you miss one dose or more, return to your normal schedule. Do not take extra doses to catch up. If you take too much, consult with your medical team. Plan ahead to make sure you have enough medication between refills.

# Other medicines

Although bad interactions with other medications are not usually a problem, it is advised not to take any prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter) medicine without informing your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking hydroxychloroquine.

# Storage

Keep out of the reach of children.

Keep it in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25 °C.

# Immunisations

Hydroxychloroquine does not interfere with* immunisations (vaccinations).

# Side Effects

Like all medicines, Hydroxychloroquine may cause side effects. In most patients it has been well tolerated, and our expectation is that you would only continue this medication if it is well tolerated. Awareness of side effects can help to prevent or deal with them effectively. The main potential side effects are:

## Visual effects
Eye damage due to Plaquenil is very rare at standard recommended doses. To minimize this risk, regular screening with an ophthalmologist is essential. The risk is minimized by keeping the dose <5mg/kg. An eye review with an ophthalmologist is recommended within the first 12 months of therapy, and if satisfactory does not need to be repeated for 5 years. After 5 years of treatment, yearly screening is recommended.  If you experience light flashes, streaks, or blurring of vision please inform your doctor. Wearing sunglasses when exposed to sunlight may help. Inform your doctor if you are taking a medication called Tamoxifen as this can increase the risk of eye damage.

## Nausea, vomiting or cramps
Please inform your doctor if you develop gut disturbance, which can usually be managed with simple measures.

## Rashes
Rare cases of these reactions have been reported, typically in the first few weeks

## Blood effects
Occasionally Hydroxychloroquine can affect the white cell count. This will be first detected in blood tests in most cases, and reverses on drug withdrawal.

## Headache, ringing in the ears
Rare cases of these reactions have been reported.

## Cancer risk
None known.

## Other side effects
Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your doctor.

# What is omalizumab and how does it work?
Omalizumab binds to and removes a specific class of antibodies called IgE in the body. In so doing, it reduces the tendency of certain cells in the skin to release histamine.

# Who is it for?
Omalizumab is for patients who suffer with chronic spontaneous urticaria and have a weekly urticaria activity score of 28 or more. Please see our information sheet on Chronic Urticaria for more information on this condition. Patients who have failed to respond to standard treatments e.g. anti-H1 antihistamines (cetirizine, loratadine), anti-H2 antihistamines (nizatidine) and leukotriene antagonist therapy (montelukast) may be offered omalizumab. Please note that omalizumab is an add-on therapy, i.e. standard antihistamine should be continued whilst taking this, though antihistamine dosages can typically be reduced.

# How is omalizumab given?
Omalizumab is given as two injections subcutaneously (under the skin) a month. Each injection contains 150 mg of omalizumab so two injections are needed to give a total dose of 300mg.

# Hospital vs home injections

 The treatment dose of 300 mg (i.e. two separate injections) is usually given every 4 weeks for 3 months initially.  You will be assessed at or after your 3rd dose, to determine whether you have had a response to treatment.  If you have responded to the treatment, doses can continue. If the urticaria comes back after you have finished the course, then you will have to be reassessed as a new patient.

# Which conditions are treated with omalizumab?
Omalizumab is used to treat patients 12 years or older with severe chronic spontaneous urticaria. It is also licensed to treat severe asthma.

# How long will I need to take omalizumab before it has an effect?
You may notice an improvement in the itching and the rash within days after the first injection. Clinical trials reported that half of the participants noticed a good improvement or complete resolution of symptoms after 3 months of injections.

# What happens if I miss a dose?
Omalizumab should be taken as prescribed and you may notice recurrence of your hives if you miss doses.

# What are the possible side effects of omalizumab?
Common and mild side effects include headache, abdominal pain, fever, joint pain and injection site reactions (bruising, swelling, redness, pain, warmth, stinging, itching). These are not usually severe and you should be able to continue the medication.
Less-common side effects include flu-like symptoms, heart burn, nausea, diarrhoea, worsening urticaria, cough, fainting, flushing, and increased risk of parasitic infection (patients who are planning travel or have been in areas with increased risk of parasitic infestation are advised to tell their doctor). Anaphylaxis with angioedema is a potentially serious allergic reaction which can very rarely occur after the injection, often within the first 2 hours. You are at a higher risk of getting this type of reaction if you have had previous anaphylaxis to food or medications or if you have asthma. You should inform your doctor or nurse if you notice any of the following during or after your injection: itching or rash, swelling of the face, neck, tongue, hands and feet, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, dizziness or faintness, an upset stomach, blurred vision, chest pain, fever or chills.

# Can omalizumab cause cancer?
There is no evidence that omalizumab increases your risk of developing cancers. Studies using omalizumab have observed patients for up to one year after treatment and therefore long-term side effects are unknown.

# Can omalizumab increase the risk of having blood clots or a stroke?
In a study of patients with asthma, it was reported that there was a small risk of developing blood clots in the legs, lungs, heart and brain. This has not been found in studies of patients treated for chronic spontaneous urticaria.

# I am planning to have an operation or dental surgery – what should I do?
There are no reported cases of omalizumab interacting with local or general anaesthetic and so it is thought to be safe. However, it is  important you inform your doctor or dentist that you are taking omalizumab. The drug does not affect wound healing or increase your risk of post-operative infection.

# How will I be monitored during treatment?
You will be observed for xxxx hours after your first injection to ensure you do not develop any signs or symptoms of an allergic reaction.  Subsequent injections require ...... hours monitoring. No routine blood tests are required. You will be seen by your doctor for a review after your 3rd treatment, as explained above.

# Does omalizumab affect pregnancy?
No studies have been performed in pregnant or breast-feeding women, so the effects on unborn children or babies being breast fed are unknown. Most clinical trials have stopped treatment if the participant became pregnant. Please inform your doctor if you are planning a pregnancy or become pregnant. Omalizumab does cross the placenta and therefore the baby can be exposed to the drug.

# May I drink alcohol while I am taking omalizumab?
There is no known interaction between omalizumab and alcohol and so it is safe to drink within the nationally recommended guidelines.

# Can I take other medicines at the same time as omalizumab?
Most medicines are safe to take with omalizumab. It is important that your doctor is aware that you are having this treatment and can assess if there is a risk of drug interaction.

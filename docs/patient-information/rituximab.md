# What is Rituximab?

**Rituximab** belongs to a new class of medications called monoclonal antibodies that specifically target single elements in the immune system leaving the rest of the immune system unaffected. In this case "B cells" are the target. 

**B cells** are white blood cells which normally produce antibodies that protect the body from infections.  However some B cells can produce harmful auto-antibodies. These are antibodies directed against components of the body and are responsible for promoting certain inflammatory diseases of the immune system. By temporarily removing the harmful B cells, Rituximab reduces inflammation and can control the underlying disease process. Rituximab also removes normal B cells from the circulation however these return some months after treatment.

Rituximab is only ever recommended when the risk of your illness outweighs the risk of therapy.

# How is Rituximab given?

Rituximab is given as an infusion into the vein which normally takes 2-4 hours. The dosage schedule varies between patients, but will commonly be 2-4 doses given at either weekly or fortnightly intervals. Even though treatment is completed in the first month, the effect persists for 6 months to one year, or even longer.

# Risks

> Your doctor will discuss possible side effects and risks with you before commencing treatment.

Rituximab can commonly cause side effects such as fever, chills, itch, flushing, chest paint or shortness of breath during an infusion. Pre-medication consisting of corticosteroids, an antihistamine and paracetamol will be given prior to each infusion to reduce these effects.

As Rituximab can cause a drop in blood pressure, your doctor may advise you to stop any blood pressure medicine temporarily during treatment.

If you are taking or have taken medicines which affect your immune system, you may have an increased risk of infections following treatment with Rituximab.

There have been reports of a very rare but serious brain infection called progressive multifocal leuko-encephalopathy (PML) usually affecting people with a weakened immune system. Rates of PML are less than 1:1000 patients treated. Your chance of getting PML may be higher if you are treated with Rituximab and/or other medicines that weaken the immune system. PML can cause severe disability or even death.

# Precautions

If you have an active infection, Rituximab will not be given until the infection is treated successfully.

Because of the risks associated with infection, a number of blood tests including testing for Hepatitis B and C, HIV and TB exposure will be performed before commencing treatment with Rituximab.

You should seek medical advice if you develop symptoms that could be due to an infection, or if you have any temperatures above 38^○^C.

# Vaccinations
As Rituximab removes antibody-forming B cells, vaccinations are less effective for several months after a course of treatment. You should plan to receive vaccinations before a course of Rituximab or between courses. Following treatment with Rituximab, you should not receive 'live' vaccines such as MMR, polio, BCG or yellow fever. Talk with your doctor before receiving any vaccines.

Pneumovax and the yearly influenza vaccination are safe and recommended to reduce your risk of those infections.

# Rituximab has particular handling and administration precautions

Rituximab was initially developed to treat certain cancers. It is usually administered in hospital by staff with experience with cancer medicines. This does not mean that you have a cancer.

# Pregnancy and Breast feeding

Rituximab therapy is not recommended during pregnancy as it is not known whether it is harmful to an unborn baby. If you are of child-bearing potential, it is recommended that you do not become pregnant for 12 months following treatment with Rituximab. You should not breastfeed during treatment with Ritusimab.

# How long is treatment continued?

A course of Rituximab can be repeated although this is guided by the return of clinical symptoms or blood tests showing a return of B cells and/or harmful autoantibodies. 

# Understanding “off-label” use of medicines
Drugs are approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use in specific diseases in Australia. Rituximab is approved for use in certain blood cancers and autoimmune diseases. Sometimes rituximab is recommended by your doctor for use for a disease for which it has not been specifically evaluated nor approved by the TGA – this is called “off-label” use. In these circumstances, the medicine can still be used, but the company cannot market it for this use, and the patient should understand there is less certainty about its effectiveness or safety in this disease as a result. We are happy to discuss this with you further.

# What is Mycophenolate?

Your illness is an inflammatory condition of the immune system. Cells of the immune system divide rapidly to generate the inflammation. Mycophenolate helps slow with the growth of these cells and has proved a great success in many patients. Since other body cells may also be affected by Mycophenolate, side effects may occur. For this reason the dose is chosen very carefully.  Before you begin treatment with Mycophenolate, you should discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.

# How fast does it work?

Mycophenolate may take some weeks to have its full benefit. Unfortunately, mycophenolate is seldom a cure for most inflammatory illnesses. Mycophenolate may be given with other drugs such as corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) which also suppress your immune system, and may provide more rapid symptom relief.

# How do I take Mycophenolate?

There are two different forms of mycophenolate -- this information relates to the Cellcept version.

The most common dose of Mycophenolate is two to three 500mg tablets twice a day (total dose 2000mg to 3000mg per day). Take the tablets/capsules whole. Do not break, chew or crush them. They may be taken with or without food.

Mycophenolate comes in 250mg and 500mg sizes. It is essential that these are not confused if you happen to be prescribed both sizes.

We will adjust the doses according to your response, any side effects you experience, and how your blood tests change.

# Understanding "Off-label" use

Mycophenolate was developed for use in transplantation. It is now used in many different illnesses because of its general value in immune diseases, and its relatively favourable safety profile. Your illness may or may not be one of the approved indications and this affects the way it is funded and supplied to you.

# Blood tests

> Regular blood tests are essential for the safe use of this medication, even if recent results have been entirely normal. Please make sure that you are clear about the schedule of blood tests we have planned for you.

# Pregnancy and Breast feeding

> Mycophenolate is NOT safe in pregnancy or breast feeding.
{.is-danger}

There is a chance that this medicine may cause birth defects if either the male or female is taking it at the time of conception or if it is taken during pregnancy. It is best to use some kind of birth control while you are taking mycophenolate and for 6 months after it has stopped. Tell your doctor right away if you think you have become pregnant while taking mycophenolate.  This medicine is not thought to put your future fertility at risk however.

# Missed dose and overdose?

It is very important to take the correct dose. If you miss one dose or more, return to your normal schedule. Do not take extra doses to catch up. If you take too much consult with your medical team. Plan ahead to make sure you have enough medication between refills.

# Other medicines

Do not take any prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine without informing your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking mycophenolate.

# Storage

-   Keep out of the reach of children.
-   Keep your capsules or tablets in the blister pack until it is time to take them.
-   Keep CellCept cool dry place where the temperature stays below 30°C.
-   Always keep the tablets away from direct light and keep the capsules away from moisture.

# Immunisations

Certain vaccines need to be used with caution in people on mycophenolate. 
> Do not have any immunisations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval.

# Side Effects of Mycophenolate

Like all medicines, mycophenolate may cause side effects. In most patients it has been well tolerated, and follow-up studies in transplantation patients who have taken it for up to six years confirm a highly favourable safety profile in comparison to other similar drugs. The main potential side effects are:

## Increased risk of infections

The immune system is required to fight infections. By dampening down immune responses the risk of infections might be greater. Any fever (temperature over 37.5°C) or infection must be reviewed by your medical team. It is advisable to have a thermometer at home. Blood test monitoring is essential to make sure that your immune system is not overly sensitive to the effects of mycophenolate.

## Diarrhoea, nausea, tummy upset 

Please inform your team if you develop any of these, as they can usually be managed with simple measures.

## Cancer risk

Any immunosuppressant drug carries a theoretical increased risk of some tumours. Mycophenolate is not known to directly cause cancer, and is likely to be safer in this regard than other immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide.

## Other side effects

Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your doctor.

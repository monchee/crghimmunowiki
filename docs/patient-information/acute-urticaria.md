# What is Urticaria

**Urticaria** is raised red itchy areas of the skin. About 20% of people have hives at some time during their lives. Acute urticaria is diagnosed when itching occurs on a daily basis for less than six weeks, but usually only lasts a few days. Urticaria lasting more than six weeks is called "Chronic urticaria" and should be thought of as a different condition.

Urticaria develops when there is a reaction that activates immune cells called mast cells in the skin. When activated, these cells release natural chemicals including histamine, which causes localised itching, redness, and swelling of the skin. In most cases, urticaria lesions appear suddenly and disappear within several hours. Itching is usually the most bothersome symptom of hives, and it may be severe enough to interfere with work and sleep.

# Angioedema 

Angioedema (soft tissue swelling) also develops in about half of patients with urticaria. Angioedema symptoms include puffiness of the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, abdomen, feet, and genitalia.

# Types of Urticaria

## Acute urticaria 

Most cases of hives are acute and will not last beyond a few days to a week or two. Triggers of acute hives can include the following:

-   **Infections** --- Infections can cause hives in some people especially children. The hives usually persist for a week or two and then disappear. The infection may not be identified by the patient.
-   **Drugs and complementary medicines** --- many types of drugs can trigger urticaria. All conventional, complementary and alternative medicines will need to be reviewed.
-   **Insect stings** --- Stings from certain insects (bees, wasps, ants) can cause hives.
-   **Food allergies** --- Food allergy can cause acute hives which typically appear within 30 minutes of eating the food. The foods most likely to cause hives in children include milk, eggs, peanuts, other nuts, soy, and wheat. The foods most likely to cause hives in adults include fish, shellfish, peanuts, and other nuts.
-   **Intolerance to food additives and natural food chemicals** --- great care is taken by Food Standards Australia and New Zealand to maintain the quality of the foods we eat. However, some people develop sensitivity to natural or added food chemicals. This is not a simple allergy and can be difficult to sort out. The [*Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Allergy Unit*](https://www.slhd.nsw.gov.au/rpa/allergy/) has a specialist interest in this field, and useful information is available from their website under "Food Intolerance".
-   **Contact urticaria** --- Hives can occur after you touch certain substances if you are allergic to them eg latex, plants, or animal saliva.
-   **Unexplained** --- failure to identify an underlying cause is common in studies of patients at specialist allergy units

## Chronic urticaria 

Chronic urticaria may look similar to acute urticaria, but is a different condition -- it is rarely caused by simple allergy, and this fact can be difficult for patients to accept. Symptoms occur daily and last longer than six weeks, sometimes for years. Chronic hives can be frustrating because they come and go and can interfere with sleep, work, or school. Chronic urticaria can be an autoimmune condition.

## Physical urticaria 

Hives can be triggered by a variety of physical factors:
-   Exposure to cold
-   Changes in body temperature or sweating
-   Vibration
-   Pressure
-   Exercise
-   Sunlight or water
-   Dermatographism (literally "skin writing"). People with this condition develop reddened, raised lines if the skin is stroked firmly or scratched.

Physical forms of hives tend to be long lasting and recurrent.

# Treatment of Acute Urticaria
Hives usually respond well to treatment.

## Avoid triggers 

If a specific cause has been identified, you will need to set up a plan to make sure you are not exposed in the future. You need to consider special circumstances where the risk of exposure is greatest and develop a plan. This will be discussed with you.

## Antihistamines 

Most people with hives respond to antihistamines, although angioedema tends to be less responsive. You may need a relatively high dose or more than one type of antihistamine to control your symptoms.

-   **Older anti-H1 antihistamines** --- Older antihistamines start to work quickly but commonly cause drowsiness or sleepiness. These medicines are therefore not recommended for people who plan to drive or operate heavy machinery. Examples include Phenergan and Polaramine.

-   **Newer anti-H1 antihistamines** --- Newer antihistamines have fewer side effects than older antihistamines. Also, newer antihistamines have to be taken less often, usually once or twice per day. Examples include:
	    1.  Levocetirizine (Xyzal) 5-20mg daily
	    2.  Cetirizine (eg Zyrtec) 10-20mg daily
	    3.  Fexofenadine (eg Telfast) 180mg-360mg daily
	    4.  Loratadine (eg Claratyne) 10-20mg daily

-   **Anti-H2 antihistamines** --- There is another type of antihistamine, commonly used to treat indigestion. These may be added to anti-H1 antihistamines for additional benefit. Examples include Ranitidine 150mg twice daily.

## Other medicines used in urticaria

Corticosteroid ("steroid") therapy is commonly used to treat severe urticaria. [Prednisone](/patient-info/prednisone) is an example. These are typically used in a short course with a tapering dose. Side effects include insomnia, agitation and increased appetite.

# Anaphylaxis

Less often urticaria can occur as part of a more serious allergic reaction called [anaphylaxis](/patient-info/anaphylaxis). You need to be able to recognize anaphylaxis and respond promptly if this occurs. Your doctor will discuss this with you if necessary in your case. Symptoms might include any one of these:

1.  Rapidly evolving severe allergic symptoms
2.  Swelling in the tongue or throat
3.  Trouble breathing
4.  Lightheadedness or passing out

> [Anaphylaxis](/patient-info/anaphylaxis) is a medical emergency and is treated differently to simple urticaria.

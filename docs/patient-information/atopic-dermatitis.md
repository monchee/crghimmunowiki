# What is Atopic Dermatitis?

**Atopic dermatitis**, also known as eczema, is a chronic skin problem that causes dry, itchy, scaly, red skin. It can occur in infants, children, and adults, and is more common in certain families. Most people with atopic dermatitis develop their first symptoms before age five. Intense dryness and itching of the skin, patches of redness, cracks and skin flaking are common. The skin may become infected and weeping.

# What causes Atopic Dermatitis?

Atopic dermatitis is not simply a skin allergy. The causes are not completely understood, although genetic factors appear to play a strong role. New discoveries have shown that the loss of the barrier function in the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis) is important. 

When the epidermis is leaky, moisture is lost from the skin ("insideout" factors) and environmental irritants, allergens, and microbes can enter the skin ("outside-in" factors). 

Scratching can cause additional skin inflammation. We also now understand that bacteria that are normally present in the skin produce proteins that aggravate inflammation -- this is not the same as the skin being infected, although infection can also be a problem.

# Treatment

Atopic dermatitis is a treatable chronic condition -- unfortunately there is no cure. It typically improves and then\
flares (worsens) periodically. Some people have no symptoms for several years.

## 1. Eliminate aggravating factors
Anything that damages the barrier surface of the skin tends to make dermatitis worse. Eliminating factors that worsen dermatitis can help to control the symptoms. Aggravating factors may include:

-   Heat, perspiration, dry environments
-   Rapid temperature changes
-   Exposure to certain chemicals or cleaning solutions, including soaps and detergents, perfumes and\
    cosmetics, wool or synthetic fibers, dust, sand, and cigarette smoke.
-   Bacteria and bacterial products on the skin surface
-   Emotional stress or anxiety is a potential factor

## 2. Keep the skin hydrated with emollients
Restoring the barrier function in the skin is the single most important daily task for patients with chronic atopic dermatitis. This is important even when the skin is well. Emollients are creams and ointments that moisturize the skin and prevent it from drying out. The best emollients for people with atopic dermatitis are thick creams (such as Dermeze®, Cetaphil®, and QV products®). Emollients are most effective when applied immediately after bathing. Lotions are less effective for moisturizing the skin than creams and ointments. Sorbolene with 10% glycerine without added perfumes may be less moisturizing than thick creams but is often more acceptable for patients over the long term. Finding the right strategy will depend on the current severity and location of your dermatitis.

## 3. Bathing
**Lukewarm baths or showers** can hydrate and cool the skin, temporarily relieving the itching of atopic dermatitis. A specialised non-soap cleanser (such as Cetaphil®) should be used sparingly. Foaming soaps should always be avoided as these extract protective oils from the skin. An emollient should be applied IMMEDIATELY after bathing or showering to prevent the skin from drying out as a result of water evaporation. Sorbolene with 10% glycerine can be used liberally all over the body in the shower, and excess can be sprayed off before patting dry with a towel.

## 4. Bleach and anti-bacterial baths
Bacteria and bacterial products on the skin surface can be an important aggravating factor in atopic dermatitis, even if the skin does not appear to be infected. Antibacterial bath additives such as QV Flare-up Bath Oil™ have been developed to help protect the skin. In some cases, a dilute bleach bath can be useful. To prepare a bleach bath, ¼ to ½ cup of normal household bleach is placed in a full bathtub of water. Bleach baths are usually taken for five to ten minutes twice per week. Do not submerge the head.

## 5. Identify and treat active skin inflammation
Learn to spot and treat active areas even if they are not very itchy. This helps to prevent major flares a few days later.

### 5.1 Predilection areas
A predilection area is a patch of skin that tends to be come inflamed over and over. Common examples would be the inner surface of the elbows or behind the knees. A maintenance strategy is required to  protect these areas in particular. Less commonly affected areas need less attention.

### 5.2 Topical steroids
Prescription steroid creams and ointments are required for areas of active inflammation. Creams are creamy and nicer to use, but may dry the skin more. Ointments are greasy and less pleasant to use, but may be more effective. 

Steroid creams and ointments are available in a variety of strengths (potencies); the least potent are available without a prescription (e.g. hydrocortisone 1% cream). More potent formulations require a prescription. Steroid creams or ointments are usually applied to the skin once or twice per day. Strong topical steroids may be needed to control active flares of atopic dermatitis. As the skin improves, an emollient can be resumed. Once the skin has improved it makes sense to continue to treat the predilection areas three days a week with a sufficiently potent steroid until the flare has settled completely. This helps to settle the cycles of flare and recovery. 

Special care is needed not to over-treat the face, but overall, patients tend to be over-cautious about controlling inflammation with topical steroid.

## 6. Other skin treatments

### 6.1 Topical calcineurin inhibitors
Newer non-steroid skin treatments for atopic dermatitis include tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. These are effective in controlling atopic dermatitis, although they do not work as quickly as topical steroids. They are useful in sensitive areas such as the face and groin.

### 6.1 Oral steroids
On rare occasions oral steroids (e.g. prednisone) are required to treat a severe flare of atopic dermatitis. This treatment is not usually recommended on a regular basis because of potential side effects.

### 6.2 Immunosuppressive drugs
Drugs that suppress the immune system may be very effective for people with severe atopic\
dermatitis who do not improve with other treatments. They take several weeks to gain effect.\
Treatment with these drugs will only be recommended when disease remains active despite a\
regular skin care routine. Additional safety concerns will need to be discussed. These medicines\
are not cures unfortunately, but for severe dermatitis can make a dramatic improvement to\
quality of life.

### 6.3 Oral antihistamines
Oral antihistamines such as cetirizine (*Zyrtec*) sometimes help relieve the itching.

### 6.4 Antibiotics
Antibiotics will be used to treat active flares where bacteria may seem to be a trigger or when\
the skin is actively infected

### 6.5 Wet dressings
See separate information sheet.

# What about Allergy?

Patients with atopic dermatitis often have additional features of allergic disease including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, food allergy and asthma. Management strategies will need to be in place for all associated conditions and this may require tests and treatment. Allergen immunotherapy has a limited role in the treatment of dermatitis but can help other features of allergic disease.

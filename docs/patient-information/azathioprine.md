# What is Azathioprine?

Your illness is an inflammatory condition of the immune system. Cells of the immune system divide rapidly to generate the inflammation. Azathioprine helps slow the growth of these cells and has proved a great success in many patients. Since other body cells may also be affected by Azathioprine, side effects may occur. For this reason the dose is chosen very carefully.

Before you begin treatment with Azathioprine, you should talk about the risks and benefits.

# How fast does it work?

Azathioprine may take some weeks to have its full benefit. Unfortunately, Azathioprine is seldom a cure for most inflammatory illnesses. Azathioprine may be given with other drugs such as corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone) which also suppress your immune system, and may provide more rapid symptom relief.

# How do I take Azathioprine?

Azathioprine comes in 25mg and 50mg tablet sizes, and is made by different manufacturers who use different brand names. It is essential that these are not confused if you happen to be prescribed different forms.

Your doses will be adjusted according to your response, any side effects you experience, and how your blood tests change.

# Blood tests

> Regular blood tests are essential for the safe use of this medication, even if recent results have been entirely normal. Please make sure that you are clear about the schedule of blood tests required.

# Pregnancy and Breast feeding

Azathioprine is a **Category D drug for pregnancy** which means that it may cause malformations or irreversible damage to an unborn baby. Clinical experience suggests this rating is incorrect. 

> There are circumstances however where physicians have *continued to recommend this drug in pregnancy. This should be fully discussed in each case.* 
{.is-warning}


Effective contraception should be used when either partner is receiving this medication. Please inform your medical team immediately if you become pregnant while taking Azathioprine. Azathioprine is excreted in small amounts in breast milk and its use by breastfeeding mothers is not recommended. If you wish to breastfeed, you should discuss this with your doctor.

# Missed dose or overdose?

It is very important to take the correct dose. If you miss one dose or more, return to your normal schedule. Do not take extra doses to catch up. If you take too much, please consult your medical team. Plan ahead to make sure you have enough medication between refills.

# Other medications

Do not take any prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine without informing your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking Azathioprine. 

> The gout drug **ALLOPURINOL (Zyloprim)** must be avoided.
{.is-danger}


# Storage

Keep out of the reach of children.

# Immunisations

Certain vaccines need to be used with caution in people on Azathioprine. 

> Do not have any immunizations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval.

# Side Effects of Azathioprine

Like all medicines, Azathioprine may cause side effects. In most patients, it is well tolerated but knowledge of side effects can help to prevent or deal with them effectively. The main side effects are:

## Increased risk of infections

The immune system is required to fight infections. By dampening down immune responses the risk of infections might be greater. Any fever (temperature over 37.5°C) or infection must be reviewed by your medical team. It is advisable to have a thermometer at home. Blood test monitoring is essential to make sure that your immune system is not overly sensitive to the effects of Azathioprine.

## Nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea 

Please inform your team if you develop gut disturbance, which can usually be managed with simple measures.

## Liver effects

Occasionally Azathioprine **can injure the liver. This will be first detected in blood tests in most cases, and reverses on drug withdrawal.**

## Allergic type reactions 

Rare cases of allergic type reactions have been described. These usually occur in the first 2 weeks. Patients report feeling unwell and may have headache, dizziness, fever, rash, muscular pains, and joint pains. If these symptoms develop, notify your medical team immediately.

## Reversible hair thinning

This medicine may cause a temporary thinning of hair in some people. Normal hair growth returns either while on treatment or after stopping.

# Cancer risk

Any immunosuppressant drug carries a theoretical risk of increased tumours, in particular skin cancers (not melanoma). Reduce this risk by wearing protective clothing and sunscreen with a high protection factor.

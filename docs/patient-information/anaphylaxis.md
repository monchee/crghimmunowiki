# What is anaphylaxis?

**Anaphylaxis** is a severe allergic reaction that causes difficulty with breathing or a drop in blood pressure. It is a treatable condition. The only difference between anaphylaxis and other forms of allergy is that the reaction threatens vital functions and is potentially life-threatening. Most people with allergies, even if they are severe, will never have anaphylaxis. Unfortunately, there are a small number of anaphylaxis deaths every year in Australia. This information sheet is designed to help you understand anaphylaxis and to set up plans to prevent and manage future attacks.

# How to recognise anaphylaxis?

Symptoms of anaphylaxis usually occur within minutes to an hour of exposure to the trigger (also known as an allergen). Patients are generally distressed with:

-   **Breathing difficulty**: throat tightness, cough, wheeze, a sensation of choking
-   **Heart and circulation**: dizziness, light-headedness, loss of consciousness due to low blood pressure

Other features may include:

-   **Skin**: itch, flushing, redness, hives or swelling
-   **Eyes**: itching, tearing, redness or swelling around the eye
-   **Nose and mouth**: sneezing, runny nose, or swelling of the tongue
-   **Digestive system**: nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps or diarrhoea
-   **Nervous system**: anxiety, confusion or incontinence

Occasionally, anaphylaxis can occur in two phases, meaning that symptoms return a few hours after treatment.

# Common triggers of anaphylaxis

-   **Foods**: peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish. Eggs, milk, wheat and soy are additional common food triggers in children. Any food including fruits, vegetables or food additives can cause anaphylaxis
-   **Insect venom**: bees, wasps, jumper ants
-   **Medications**: commonly antibiotics, aspirin, anti-inflammatories, anaesthetic agents
-   **Latex**: found in gloves, balloons, condoms and medical products
-   **Exercise**: either alone or in combination with specific food or medication triggers
-   **Idiopathic**: sometimes the cause remains a mystery

# Management of anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. You need to call an ambulance and activate your anaphylaxis plan if you have one. Adrenaline is life-saving and needs to be administered urgently if there is a threat to airway, breathing or circulation.

## Adrenaline auto-injectors

If you have a history of anaphylaxis, you may have been advised to carry an adrenaline auto-injector, "Epipen" or "Anapen" with you at all times. If you have one of these devices, it is important that you are familiar with when and how to use it -- this is called an Action plan. You will still need to attend a hospital emergency department due to the risk of symptoms returning after administration of Adrenaline.

# Prevention of anaphylaxis

Following an episode of anaphylaxis, you will need to be assessed to determine the cause of the reaction. This will require a thorough history and further assessment with skin and blood tests. Once a trigger is identified, you should avoid exposure to that particular trigger. If a food trigger is identified, you should eliminate this from your diet. 

This can be difficult and will involve reading food labels and asking about the ingredients in foods eaten or prepared out of the home. In the case of medication allergies, you need to avoid the particular medication and possibly also others within the same class. 

Your doctor may provide you with a MedicAlert identification device to alert treating doctors of your allergy. 

Immunotherapy, or desensitization, is a treatment strategy that decreases the risk of anaphylaxis to insect venom. It is not available for other triggers such as foods or medications. In some cases, no cause of anaphylaxis is found after a thorough search and allergy tests. Your doctor will advise you how to manage this condition.

# How do I manage the Adrenaline self-injector, "Epipen" or "Anapen"?

If this is prescribed, it is important that you promptly attend a pharmacy to obtain the device. You will be given and "Action Plan". You need to carry it with you at all times and be familiar with how and when to use it. In the case of children, one device can be kept at school and the other at home. You will be given a written action plan with a clear management plan for any further episodes.

It is important that you obtain a further prescription if the device is beyond its **expiry date** or if you have used it to treat anaphylaxis.

# Planning for travel

If you have had anaphylaxis you should make special plans for times when you will be away from home, or visiting places that are remote from emergency medical care. Think about how to avoid the allergen trigger, and what you would do if anaphylaxis occurred, who could assist you if you got into trouble. Airline travel may require a travel authority for the adrenaline autoinjector which should be carried with you on the plane.

# Where can I get more information?

Further information and support is available from Allergy and Anaphylaxis Australia (allergyfacts.org.au) or the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy ([allergy.org.au](http://allergy.org.au/)). 

> If you do not have an anaphylaxis plan and think you might be at risk, ask your doctor to provide one, or to make a referral to an allergy specialist.

# What is Risedronate (Actonel)?

**Risedronate** is a member of a family of medicines called bisphosphonates. This class of medicines has been a great advance in preventing a common side effect of steroid therapy called osteoporosis. It is usually combined with calcium and vitamin D.

**Osteoporosis** is a loss of the mineral content of bone that occurs slowly over time, causing no symptoms until such time as the bones are vulnerable to fracture from minimal trauma. Some assessment of your risk of osteoporosis can be made by considering the total amount of steroid exposure, and by measuring your bone strength with simple bone mineral density (BMD) tests. We now know that it is essential to prevent bone loss before it occurs in patients who require steroid therapy for inflammatory diseases.

Before you begin treatment with Risedronate, you should talk about the risks and benefits.

# Am I eligible to receive Risedronate?

You have been prescribed Risedronate because you qualify under the PBS criteria as listed below:
-   You will be on long term steroid therapy (at least 3 months)
-   You are taking  at least 7.5mg per day of prednisolone or equivalent
-   You have a bone mineral density T score of -- 1.5 or less
-   You must be more than 18 years of age.

# How do I take Risedronate?

Risedronate is provided in a combination pack for convenience, 'Actonel Combi D' : One Actonel 35mg Once-a-Week tablet (the small light-orange tablet) and 6 sachets containing calcium carbonate 2500mg and cholecalciferol 22mcg (Vitamin D3 880 IU).

## Day 1
Take the Actonel 35mg tablet in the morning, at least 30 minutes before your first meal, drink or medication of the day. Swallow your Actonel 35mg tablet whole with a glass of plain water. Do not chew the tablet. Actonel is most effective when your stomach is empty. Take your Actonel 35mg tablet while sitting or standing upright. Do not lie down immediately after swallowing it. Stay upright, for at least 30 minutes after swallowing your tablet. This will help make sure the tablet reaches your stomach quickly and helps avoid irritation to your oesophagus.

Take your Actonel 35mg tablet on the same day each week. This tablet should be taken each week. Choose a day of the week that suits you the best.

## Day 2 to 7
**Take one sachet the day after you start taking the Actonel 35mg tablet, for the following 6 days. The contents of the sachet should be poured into a glass of plain water (approximately 200mL), stirred and drunk immediately once the fizzing has subsided.

# Other medications

Some medicines and Actonel Combi D may interfere with each other if taken at the same time. These include:

-   Antacids used to treat indigestion eg Gaviscon, Mylanta
-   Other products containing calcium
-   Iron supplements

# Dental check

Dental assessment and treatment should be completed before commencing Risedronate. Your dentist should be informed that bisphosphonate therapy is planned. Maintain good oral hygiene.  You may need to take an antibiotic if you need a dental procedure. See ONJ below.

# Pregnancy and Breast feeding

In the absence of adequate available experience in human pregnancy, **Risedronate should not be used during pregnancy.**  Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, breastfeeding should be discontinued before Risedronate is used.

# Side Effects of Risedronate

Like all medicines, Risedronate may cause side effects. In most patients it is very well tolerated.

- **Heartburn and indigestion**. Make sure you are following the instructions to remain upright for 30 minutes after each dose. If this persists discuss with your doctor.
- **Dental problems**. High dose bisphosphonate therapy has been associated with a very rare severe side effect affecting the teeth and jaw -- osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). The risk of ONJ is very small: less than 1 case in 100,000 patient-treatment-years. Known risk factors for ONJ include: high dose therapy (10-20x the dose used in osteoporosis); diagnosis of cancer; simultaneous chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and corticosteroids; poor oral hygiene; and pre-existing dental disease (e.g. infection of the gums/ jaws)
- **Other side effects** not listed above may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your doctor.

# What is an allergen challenge?

An allergen challenge is used to determine whether an allergic reaction to a test substance exists or not. The aim of the procedure is to safely determine whether the test substance can be tolerated in a quantity and form that will be encountered in the future. These tests are usually performed when the risk of a reaction is likely to be low.

The procedure is performed under supervised conditions in the Department of Clinical Immunology as per an approved departmental protocol. Certain challenges which are considered high-risk may be performed in the operating theatre recovery area which allows immediate access to medical assistance.

# What to expect on the day

On the day of the procedure you will be given further details on the procedure and asked to sign a hospital consent form. An intravenous cannula will be inserted.

You will be given the test substance in a very small amount as the initial dose. You will be observed carefully following the dose for any symptoms of an allergic reaction such as skin rash, mouth itch/tingling, angioedema or vomiting. You will have regular measurements of heart rate, blood pressure and peak expiratory flow rate.  If there are no signs of a reaction, you will then be given gradually increasing amounts of the test food at regularly spaced time intervals. Monitoring for any sign of a reaction will occur throughout the procedure and particularly prior to administration of the next food dose.

Following the last dose, you will need to remain in the department for observation for a minimum of two hours if there has been no reaction. This may be extended to 4 hours or longer if a clinical reaction has occurred. At a minimum, the entire procedure will take several hours.

# How to prepare for the procedure

Prior to the day, the challenge procedure will be discussed with you by the Clinical Nurse Specialist. You will be advised if you are required to bring in the test substance, and if so, how it is to be prepared and handled.

You will need to be fasting for four hours although can take your morning medications with a sip of water. Certain medications need to be avoided (see below). On the day of the procedure, a checklist will be reviewed prior to commencing the challenge.

# What are the risks of a Clinical Allergen Challenge?

An allergic reaction to one of the administered doses of the test substance is the main risk associated with a challenge procedure. An allergic reaction can vary in severity from a mild reaction with local or skin symptoms only, to a severe reaction affecting airway, breathing and circulation which requires adrenaline and resuscitation as per anaphylaxis guidelines. All medications required to treat an allergic reaction are available for immediate use prior to commencement of the challenge. Late reactions may occur up to 24 hours after completion of the challenge regardless of whether a reaction has occurred during the procedure.

# Checklist for Allergen Challenge

- [ ] You must be fasting for at least 4 hours. Regular medications can be taken in the morning with a sip of water.
- [ ] You must be otherwise well, and free of active asthma or acute infections.
- [ ] You must not take an anti-histamine for a full 72 hours before the challenge. Many over-the-counter cold and flu preparations contain anti-histamines as an ingredient and must be avoided also.
- [ ] You must not take aspirin or medications from the anti-inflammatory family (Mobic, Nurofen, Voltaren etc) for 24 hours prior to the challenge.
- [ ] You must not be taking blood pressure lowering medications which belong to the beta-blocker or ACE inhibitor family. Check with your doctor if you are on any of these medications well prior to the day. Note that beta blocker medications must not be suddenly stopped as this can cause serious cardiac events.
- [ ] If you are a female of child-bearing age, you will need to provide results of a pregnancy test to confirm you are not pregnant. We will advise how to arrange this so that results can be available on the day.

# What will happen after the challenge is completed?

Following the procedure, you will be advised if the challenge indicates that you can safely tolerate the test substance in the future.

- **In the case of a positive challenge** (an allergic reaction does occur), this will be treated appropriately and your observation period will be extended. You may be required to stay overnight in the hospital for further observation. On discharge, you may be given an antihistamine or other medications to take for a few days. Because of the risk of a late reaction (see above), you will be given a letter of instruction that you can provide to a doctor advising of your challenge procedure and how best to manage a late reaction. You will be advised to avoid the test substance to which the reaction occurred and provided with an action plan to manage any future reactions which may occur in the event of accidental exposure.


- **In the case of a negative challenge** (no clinical reaction), you will be observed for a minimum of two hours after the last dose. If you tolerate the challenge with no sign of an allergic reaction it is very unlikely that you will have a further allergic reaction to that test substance in the future. However, future tolerance can never be guaranteed and a recommended action plan will be discussed should any reactions occur in the future. Because of the risk of a late reaction (see above), you will be given a letter of instruction that you can provide to a doctor advising of your challenge procedure and how best to manage a late reaction.

For all patients, a follow-up appointment will be arranged if necessary.

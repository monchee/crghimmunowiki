# What is Prednisone?

**Prednisone** is a synthetic hormone commonly referred to as "steroids". These are not the same steroids as body builders might use. Prednisone is very similar to cortisone - a corticosteroid hormone normally produced by your adrenal glands. Prednisone is remarkably effective for the treatment of inflammatory diseases of the immune system.  The Nobel Prize for Medicine was awarded in 1950 for this discovery. Despite its great benefits, prednisone therapy has important difficulties.

# How does Prednisone work?

Prednisone works by suppressing the body's immune system to control inflammation (heat, redness, swelling, & pain). Prednisone may be effective within hours.  It does not generally cure inflammatory diseases. It is often used in combination with other medicines.

# What is the usual dose of Prednisone?

-   Prednisone is taken by mouth (tablets). Other corticosteroids can be given by injection.
-   Prednisone is available in 1, 5 and 25 mg tablets. The dose is variable.
-   Generally high doses are used at first to gain control of your condition and then reduced (weaned) over days or weeks. Quite often a low dose maintenance strategy is used (less than 10mg/day) for longer periods.

> You must be absolutely clear about your own dose plan.

# How often do I take Prednisone?

Prednisone is usually taken once a day in the morning. Taking your prednisone in the morning with breakfast mimics your body's natural production of corticosteroid hormones.

# Other medicines

Do not take any prescription or non-prescription (over-the-counter) medicine without informing your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking prednisone.

# Immunisations

Certain vaccines need to be used with caution in people on steroids. 

> Do not have any immunisations (vaccinations) without your doctor's approval.

# Is Prednisone safe in Pregnancy?

> It is generally advisable to avoid all medications during pregnancy and while you are trying to become pregnant. However, Prednisone is believed to be one of the safer medications and has been used safely and successfully during pregnancy.

# What are the side-effects of Prednisone?

Not all patients who take prednisone have side-effects. The side-effects are largely related to the dose and the length of time you take the prednisone. Therefore, higher doses taken for long periods of time are more likely to cause side-effects.

## Short-term side effects

As the dose of prednisone is decreased and stopped these side-effects disappear.

- **Mood and Energy levels**. Some patients feel full of energy (euphoric) which may result in difficulty with sleeping, while others may feel depressed or irritable.
- **Appetite**. You may feel hungrier which can result in weight gain.
- **Nausea or indigestion**. Report these symptoms if they occur.
- **Resistance to infection**. Any infections or fevers should be taken seriously and reviewed by your doctor.
- **Blood sugar** sometimes rise. At worst this may result in Type 2 diabetes, and require dose adjustment, or other therapies.
- **Blood pressure** may rise and fluid retention may occur. Blood pressure can drop if steroids are stopped suddenly.

## Long-term side-effects

These side-effects might occur when Prednisone has been used for long periods of time. In many patients, the side-effects can be reduced by appropriate prevention.

-   **Skin changes**. Acne, hair growth, easy bruising, or wounds which take longer to heal.
-   **Cataracts or glaucoma** may develop.
-   Loss of calcium from the bones resulting in **fragile bones** (osteoporosis).
-   **Damage to bones** (osteonecrosis). This can occur in any bone but the most common site is the hip, resulting in groin pain.
-   Prednisone rarely causes the muscles around the hips and shoulders to become weak.

# How can I help to minimize the side-effects of Prednisone?

-   Take your Prednisone as prescribed and attend regular follow-up visits.
-   Taking your Prednisone with food can help reduce problems with nausea.
-   Follow a diet to maintain your weight.
-   Your doctor may assess your bone density and prescribe a medication to reduce the risk of osteoporosis

# **Managing weight while taking steroids**

Prednisone can cause people to gain weight.  When starting steroids, if you are overweight or notice weight gain you may use the following ideas to reduce weight gain.

-   Regular exercise.  Try 30 minutes of walking a day if you are able.
-   Drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.  Thirst is often confused for hunger!
-   Limit high fat, high sugar foods and drinks. Examples include: chocolate, sausage rolls, hot chips, flavoured milk, juice, soft drink, crackers with cheese, butter, mayonnaise, peanut butter and most takeaway foods. 
-   Snack on low energy foods.  Examples include: vegetable sticks with salsa, vita wheats with cottage cheese and tomato, glass of skim milk, tub of diet yoghurt, fresh fruit.
-   Avoid salt.  Don't add salt to cooking and avoid high salt packaged food.
-   Manage stress to prevent emotional eating.
-   Include plenty fresh fruit and vegetables.
-   Watch portions at meal times.  Your dinner plate should be:
    - non-starchy vegetables (all vegetables except corn and potato)
    - proteins (meat, eggs, beans, chicken, fish, tofu etc.)
    - bread, cereals or starchy vegetables (bread, pasta, potato etc.)

If still hungry after a meal try having a glass of water or have more salad or non-starchy vegetables.

# How do I stop the Prednisone?

> **DO NOT STOP YOUR PREDNISONE ABRUPTLY.**
{.is-danger}

This can make you quite ill. Prednisone needs to be **gradually reduced.**  This is called weaning. You will be provided with a weaning strategy and you should be clear about the doses that are required. Please ask if it is not clear.

# Missed dose and overdose?

It is very important to take the correct dose. If you miss one dose or more, return to your normal schedule. Do not take extra doses to catch up. If you take too much, consult with your medical team. Plan ahead to make sure you have enough medication between refills.

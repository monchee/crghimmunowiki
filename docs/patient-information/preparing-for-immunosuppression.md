# What is immunosuppression?

**Immunosuppression** is the term used to describe a whole group of different medical approaches to reducing damage caused by the immune system. Immunosuppressive medications alter the way the immune system functions mainly to reduce inflammation that is causing ill-health. These medicines are designed to "re-tune" the immune system rather than stopping it from functioning altogether.

Different combinations of immunosuppressive medicines are used for individual diseases based on clinical trials, other forms of research and clinical experience of doctors. We will discuss with you the particular options available in your case. Strong combinations of treatments are often required. Immunosuppression will only be recommended if the expected benefits outweigh the potential for harm. The aim is to control disease, without developing side effects of therapy. Some risks are involved however.

Remember, the medicines you take are your own choice.

# Aims of therapy

Immunosuppressive medicines are used in combinations and the doses vary with time. Typically, stronger combinations are used at the start to bring the disease under control (remission), and then milder doses are required to stop the illness from returning (maintenance phase to prevent relapse).

A successful *maintenance phase* has all three of the following:

1.  Inflammation and organ damage is controlled
2.  There are no important side effects of medicines
3.  Prednisone doses (if used) are 7.5mg per day or less

Eventually many patients with inflammatory diseases can cease medicines altogether. You should understand the aims of treatment in your case.

# Assessing the risks of immunosuppression

Here at Concord Hospital we have developed an internationally recognised program to assess and manage the risks of immunosuppression for an individual patient ([www.immunosuppressionscreen.net.au](http://www.immunosuppressionscreen.net.au/)). We will take you through this process before a final decision is made about the treatments that suit you best.

# What can you do to prevent adverse outcomes of immunosuppression?

1.  Take medicines carefully as instructed.
2.  If you are not clear about what you are being asked to do, ask questions.
3.  Keep a list of all your current medicines and their doses available for clinic appointments.
4.  Be aware of the likely side effects of therapy, and report symptoms that are causing concern.
5.  Manage your diet carefully if you are taking steroid therapy -- see additional information.
6.  We will provide a strategy to prevent osteoporosis for those on steroid therapy for more than 3 months.
7.  Be aware that steroid therapy should not be stopped abruptly as that may leave your adrenal gland unable to supply essential hormones to your body. We will provide a strategy for safe dose reduction over time.
8.  Stop smoking if you are a smoker. We can support you to quit.
9.  Keep as active as you can -- physical activity is very important in maintaining mood and preventing weight gain and other effects of therapy.
10. Be up to date with vaccines as advised. Some vaccines are not safe in the immunosuppressed. We can assist with this.
11. Discuss your fertility with us. Use effective contraception methods if required.
12. Have a thermometer available and a fever plan -- know what to do if your temperature is ≥38°C.

Immunosuppression can seem like a long journey -- recruit the support of family and friends. Help them understand the aims of treatment and the different phases that are planned.

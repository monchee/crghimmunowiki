# Why is Alemtuzumab being recommended in my condition?

You have been diagnosed with an autoimmune inflammatory condition of the immune system. "Autoimmune" means that the immune system has started to attack one or more organs of the body causing inflammation and tissue damage. Alemtuzumab is a strong medicine designed to specifically target the parts of the immune system that are involved in generating that attack. Alemtuzumab is only recommended when the benefits of treatment are likely to outweigh the risks of leaving the condition untreated.

# About Alemtuzumab

Alemtuzumab was developed to treat people with a form of blood cancer (CLL), but it is increasingly used for autoimmune diseases, mainly multiple sclerosis (MS). The dose and frequency of alemtuzumab treatment used for MS are much lower than when it is used to treat cancer.

# Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

MS is one form of autoimmune inflammatory disease of the immune system. The target in this case is cells in the brain and spinal cord. Alemtuzumab has been used as an experimental treatment of MS since 1991. Several studies have shown that it is effective. For instance, one trial compared alemtuzumab to interferon-beta (Rebif), in people with relapsing-remitting MS. This trial was called "CAMMS223". Alemtuzumab reduced progression of disability as well as the risk of having a relapse by over two thirds. There were more side-effects associated with Alemtuzumab.

# Is Alemtuzumab suitable for me?

We will take you through a risk assessment process before prescribing Alemtuzumab that will help us identify any particular concerns about the use of this medication in your case.

# How is Alemtuzumab given?

Alemtuzumab is given as an infusion into a vein in your arm over four hours. These infusions are mostly given in hospital as an inpatient.

For the first course of alemtuzumab, you will have an infusion (12 mg) every day for five consecutive days. There is no further alemtuzumab until at least 12 months later, when you will receive a similar daily infusion but for three days only. The need for subsequent infusions will be assessed on an individual patient basis. Sometimes this will involve further MRI scans to obtain information.

You will also receive an intravenous course of steroids (methylprednisolone) given as an infusion for approximately 1 hour just before each dose of alemtuzumab.

# What are the side-effects of Alemtuzumab?

The risks described below are the well known ones based upon experience in clinical trials.

## Infusion-related risks

The first or second dose of alemtuzumab may be associated with the symptoms listed below. Your doctor will give you an antihistamine and paracetamol, as well as IV steroids, before the alemtuzumab infusion to reduce the side effects further. The possible side effects are

-   Worsening of current or old symptoms from MS. This lasts only for a few hours and does not lead to permanently increased disability.
-   Rash (raised itchy red spots on the skin) which can be treated with anti histamine medication.
-   Fever, headache, and fatigue -- may last for a few hours.
-   Rigor/chills (feeling cold and shaking).
-   Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea -- this happens rarely.
-   Shortness of breath and/or spasms in the windpipe, especially in patients with asthma.
-   A drop in blood pressure that may cause dizziness, headache and fatigue.

## Risk of bleeding from a Low Platelet Count

Alemtuzumab treatment in people with MS has been associated with a low platelet count (called "thrombocytopenia"). Platelets help form blood clots. Therefore a low platelet count may lead to an increased risk of bleeding, and so can cause easy bruising, bleeding of the gums, nosebleeds, unusually heavy menstrual periods, or any other unusual bruising or bleeding. There have been some confirmed cases of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) among alemtuzumab-treated patients (less than 5% of patients) which can occur for some years after treatment. To identify any fall in platelets as early as possible, all people treated with alemtuzumab must have monthly blood tests for 5 years. If the platelet count drops significantly or goes down to a low level, the blood tests will be done on a weekly basis for at least 8 weeks until the platelet count stops decreasing or until it starts increasing and then monthly blood tests for three years after receiving alemtuzumab.

## Increased Risk of Infection

## Listeria

For the first few months after Alemtuzumab, there is an increased risk of infections from a bacteria called Listeria from unpasteurised milk products. If severe, these might need hospital treatment and have the potential to lead to death. The risk of Listeria can be reduced significantly by following simple dietary advice (foods to avoid). You will be provided with a list of foods to avoid.

Autoimmune neutropenia, a decrease in white blood cells can occur and this too can increase the risk to certain infections. This results from a similar mechanism to the low platelet count and can occur years after the infusion. The monthly blood counts will also help identify low white blood cells. 

## Varicella (chicken pox or shingles)

Over the next few months, there is also an increased risk of viral infections such as shingles or measles. If you receive alemtuzumab, you should avoid contact with anyone who has symptoms of chicken pox or shingles. If you are exposed to these infections, please notify your doctor as soon as possible. Preferably patients should be confirmed to have had chickenpox exposure or be vaccinated prior to treatment with alemtuzumab. Currently available chickenpox vaccines are not safe after treatment with alemtuzumab, at least for many months. Patients with previous chickenpox or vaccination are still at risk of shingles. This usually presents with an intense band of pain followed by a rash in the skin affected on one side of the body, anywhere on the body. If you think you may be developing shingles after treatment with alemtuzumab, please notify your MS centre, as early administration of antiviral medication can reduce the severity of symptoms.

## Herpes Simplex Type 1 and 2

If you have a history of herpes infections (cold sores or genital herpes), they may recur following treatment with alemtuzumab. If you experience cold sores, a herpes outbreak, or have any unexplained rash, please contact your doctor since anti-viral medicines are available that can reduce the severity of the outbreak. A preventative anti-viral medication is usually given for the first month after treatment with alemtuzumab.

## Human Papilloma Virus (Cervical Dysplasia)

Women infected with human Papilloma virus (HPV) are at increased risk for cervical cancer. That risk may increase after immune suppression by alemtuzumab. A gynaecological exam with Papanicolaou (Pap) smear and HPV screening performed within a year prior to the start of alemtuzumab treatment is strongly recommended for all women. An annual gynaecological exam with Pap smear and HPV screening is strongly recommended for all women.

## Vaccinations

> You should not receive a live vaccine. 
{.is-warning}

The routine influenza (flu) vaccine is however both safe and recommended.  It is important that you check with your doctor before receiving any vaccine. If your doctor is unsure they can contact the MS centre.

## Thyroid problems

There is up to 30% chance of developing a disease of the thyroid gland, most commonly an overactive thyroid gland (Graves' disease). If untreated, the symptoms of Graves' disease would be: increased sweating, anxiety, weight loss, tremor and sometimes pain in the neck. If needed, the first treatment is tablets. These are normally given for 6 months and then stopped. If the thyroid gland still remains overactive, it can be permanently suppressed by radioactive iodine treatment. After radioactive treatment, it is usually necessary to take thyroid tablets for life. One symptom of Graves' disease that may not be easily controlled by tablets is swelling of the eyes. This progressive swelling may look unpleasant and may even compromise vision. It may require treatment with steroids, radiotherapy or surgery. We will refer anyone with thyroid disease to a local specialist.

## Goodpasture's Syndrome

This is a very rare disease that affects the lungs and kidneys. It often leads to kidney failure and the need for dialysis or even kidney transplantation. Treatment can be effective if begun very early and consists of washing the blood ("plasma exchange") and powerful drugs like prednisolone, cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.

## Risks Associated with Methylprednisolone

People taking methylprednisolone can experience an unpleasant taste in the mouth, tingling in their limbs, difficulty sleeping and a burst of energy. Rarely stomach bleeds can happen. These symptoms all resolve soon after infusion.

# Fertility and Harm to the Unborn Child

There is no information available about the effects of alemtuzumab on fertility and pregnancies, and it is potentially harmful. There is a possibility that alemtuzumab might transiently reduce or affect fertility in both men and women.

Alemtuzumab may be harmful to an unborn child. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should not take alemtuzumab. Both men and women who are capable of childbearing should use an effective form of birth control for 12 months after each dose of Alemtuzumab. If you become pregnant, you should notify your doctor and let your MS specialist know so that management of the pregnancy can be discussed.

# Risks of combining Alemtuzumab with other drugs

We do not know all the side effects that may arise from the combination of alemtuzumab with other drugs so you should always discuss the use of any drugs (over-the-counter, prescription, illegal, herbal or nutritional supplement) with your doctor or pharmacist.

# What Do I need to do after having had Alemtuzumab?

For the first 2 weeks after treatment with Alemtuzumab, you may experience more fatigue than you are used to. For the next 12 weeks, you are at special risk of infections. Simple colds and viral infections are common and will be no different in severity or duration if you catch them. Please let your GP and your MS specialist know if you think you may have an infection.

For three months, avoid food that might contain Listeria (see below). If you are on other medication, please check with your doctor or pharmacist first. It is best to avoid herbal or alternative remedies. If you see a doctor or nurse about any health issue, make sure that they know you have received alemtuzumab.

Do not have live vaccinations. Make sure adequate vaccinations as usual are in place before foreign travel. Travel to countries where infections such as tuberculosis are common is not recommended.

Please ensure that you have a monthly blood test to check your platelet count. Look out for signs and symptoms of a low platelet count: easy bruising, bleeding of the gums, nosebleeds, unusually heavy menstrual periods, or any other unusual bruising or bleeding. If you have any of these, you must seek attention within 24 hours. Please contact your GP. We will ask you to get a "full blood count" test as soon as possible. This blood test is widely available. If you cannot contact your GP, the safest thing to do is to go to your nearest A&E Department and show them this document and explain your concerns.

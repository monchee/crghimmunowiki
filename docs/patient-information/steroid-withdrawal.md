You have been receiving prednisone therapy for a while. We need to discuss how to reduce and cease prednisone in a way that is safe. This is normally quite easy to do, but we need to do things correctly.

# About prednisone withdrawal

Prednisone is very similar to cortisone -- an important hormone normally produced by your own body. When you have been taking prednisone for more than three weeks your body may be unable to produce enough cortisone. Various withdrawal symptoms may occur until your body resumes making natural steroids over a few weeks. In rare cases, lack of cortisone can be dangerous.

# What are the symptoms of steroid withdrawal?

The withdrawal symptoms can be serious, and in rare cases life-threatening. They include:

-   Weakness, tiredness, feeling sick, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia), and low blood pressure (hypotension) which can cause dizziness, fainting or collapse.

Typically withdrawal will be worse when the body is under stress for another reason such as surgery or a major infection.

# Key points

1.  Do not stop taking oral steroids suddenly if you have been taking them for 3 weeks or more.
2.  Changes in prednisone dose should be supervised by your doctor.
3.  If the dose is reduced gradually, the body gradually resumes its natural production of steroids and the withdrawal symptoms do not occur. Gradual dose reduction is often called steroid weaning.
4.  Extra "steroid cover" doses may be needed during periods of stress (such as surgery, or a major infection), even up to a year after stopping corticosteroid therapy. If you are unwell with a major fever and are unable to get to a doctor, take prednisone 15mg daily until medical review, or when the fever resolves.
5.  If you are unsure, let us know so we can help.

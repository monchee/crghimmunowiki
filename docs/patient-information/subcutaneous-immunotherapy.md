# What is Immunoglobulin replacement?

Immunoglobulin, also known as antibody is a product derived from donated blood. The immunoglobulin component is separated from the red blood cells, and contains antibodies used by the body to fight infection. Low levels of Immunoglobulins can occur due to a variety of medical conditions, and places patients at increased risk of infection. Replacement therapy allows restoration of normal immunoglobulin levels with the aim of preventing infections and other complications.

Immunoglobulin infusions can occur intravenously (via a needle inserted into a vein, usually every 4 weeks) or subcutaneously (via a needle inserted under the skin) every week. Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin replacement has been successfully used in Europe for more than 20 years and is the most common route of replacement therapy.

# What subcutaneous Immunoglobulin products are available in Australia?

There are 2 different Immunoglobulin products approved for subcutaneous use in Australia: - Evogam and Hizentra. These products vary slightly in composition and storage requirements, but when administered at the correct dose, all provide adequate immunoglobulin replacement.

# What are the advantages of subcutaneous therapy?

Intravenous infusions of Immunoglobulin occur in a supervised hospital setting, require insertion of a needle into a vein, and can take 3-4 hours. Subcutaneous infusions are performed at home at a time convenient to you, and carry less risk of a serious reaction. Appropriate training will be provided which will enable you to give yourself your treatment at home.

# How is the subcutaneous Immunoglobulin administered?

The rate of subcutaneous Immunoglobulin infusion is controlled via an infusion pump. You will be provided a pump by the hospital for your infusions, and will receive training in its use and maintenance. This pump will remain the property of the hospital, and must be returned if no longer in use.

You will be required to attend the hospital for training in subcutaneous infusion, with weekly training sessions for 4-6 weeks. During this time, you will be trained in all aspects of home infusion, including cleanliness, insertion of the needle and use of the pump. You will also be instructed in how to manage problems if they occur. You will only be approved to commence home therapy once the training nurse is satisfied that it is safe to do so.

# How do I transport and store the product at home?

You will need to collect the product from the Concord Hospital Pharmacy every 4 weeks and will be required to pay a dispensing fee at that time. The product will be dispensed by Pharmacy in insulated packaging, such as an esky, which should be placed in the refrigerator as soon as possible.Â  The storage requirements of your particular product will be advised once you commence therapy.

# What else do I need for home infusions?

Apart from the Immunoglobulin product and pump, home infusions require medical equipment such as needles, connecting tubing and surgical tape. These will be supplied when you collect the Immunoglobulin product. You will also be provided with a container to dispose of used needles ('sharps') and instructed in where to exchange this when full.

# What are the side effects?

All medical products, including blood products can have associated risks. Immunoglobulin product has been thoroughly screened and purified during manufacturing to eliminate known viruses.

The most common side effect of subcutaneous Immunoglobulin infusion is discomfort, redness and tenderness at the infusion site. This is common, and usually settles with continued therapy, particularly if the product is given at the same site.

# Are there any alternative therapies?

Immunoglobulin replacement can be given via the intravenous route, and you may already be receiving this. If this is the case, then commencement of subcutaneous therapy will be timed so that there is no risk of interruption to replacement requirements.

Apart from immunoglobulin infusion via the intravenous or subcutaneous route, there are no other available treatments to restore normal Immunoglobulin levels.

# How often do I need to see my treating team?

Once you have completed 6 months of home infusions, you will need to attend the hospital for a supervised infusion to check your technique.

Your specialist will see you at least once every 6 months, to assess your progress on home subcutaneous therapy. However you can contact the Immunology registrar or Immunology nurses if you have any concerns and an earlier appointment may be arranged.

# What will subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy cost?

Subcutaneous therapy products and equipment are provided to you at no additional cost.

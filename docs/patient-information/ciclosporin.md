# What is ciclosporin?

Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressant - a medication that suppresses immune responses. The immune system is responsible for your illness. Ciclosporin acts by damping down inflammation by its effect on certain immune cells called lymphocytes.

Ciclosporin may be highly effective in the majority of patients, but there is variation in its benefits between individuals. For this reason it is often prescribed on a trial basis, and doses may need to be reviewed with time. Responses are usually seen within the first two weeks. It may take up to 8 weeks for the full benefits to take effect.

# How is it taken?

Ciclosporin is normally taken by patients for a minimum of several months and up to several years.

The dose is usually 2 - 5 mg/kg body weight per day. The capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water at the same times each day 12 hours apart after breakfast and dinner.

# Monitoring

As a powerful medication, ciclosporin may have some serious side effects. It is essential to follow your doctor's advice regarding monitoring of your health. This is especially important when you have first been prescribed the medication, but some side effects become more likely after several months' treatment.

-   Blood pressure should be measured two-weekly for the first 2 months, then monthly thereafter.
-   Kidney function should be tested by blood and urine tests, two-weekly for the first 2 months, then monthly thereafter.
-   Other regular tests should include: complete blood count, liver function, fasting lipid levels, uric acid.

# Vaccinations

Vaccination may be less effective during treatment with ciclosporin.  Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during treatment with ciclosporin. Please check with your prescribing doctor prior to receiving any vaccines whilst taking ciclosporin.

# Interactions with other medications

Certain medications should be avoided by patients on ciclosporin. Examples include:

-   Grapefruit juice
-   Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg. indomethacin, naproxen)
-   Antibiotics (eg. cotrimoxasole, rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin)
-   Anti-epileptics (eg. phenytoin, carbamazepine)
-   Antifungals (eg. Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole)
-   St John's wort (hypericum perforatum).

Please check with your prescribing doctor whether any of your current medications will interact with ciclosporin.

# Side Effects

Side effects are related to DOSE and DURATION of treatment. Some of the side effects listed below apply to longer-term treatment. Many patients take this medication without experiencing serious side effects.

Side-effects from ciclosporin may include:

-   **High blood pressure** which may require additional medication for control.
-   **Increased cholesterol**.
-   A reduction in **kidney function**, which may necessitate reducing the dose of ciclosporin or occasionally stopping it.
-   Increased **hair growth** (bleaching, shaving, and hair removal creams may be used).
-   Loss of **appetite and nausea**.
-   **Pins and needles** sensation in fingers, toes or lips.
-   **Tremor**.
-   Swollen or **bleeding gums**. Brush your teeth regularly and massage your gums with a soft toothbrush. Use dental floss daily, and attend for regular dental check-ups.
-   **Increased risk of bacterial, fungal or viral infections**. See your doctor promptly if you develop fevers or infections.
-   **Possible increased risk of cancer**, particularly certain treatable forms of skin cancer. 
-   **Protect yourself from sun exposure**, wear covering clothing outdoors, and apply broad spectrum sunscreen to all exposed skin daily. This is less likely with the doses of medication usually used in inflammatory diseases.

# Pregnancy / lactation

Although ciclosporin does not appear to be teratogenic, it is generally avoided in pregnancy.  Ciclosporin may pass into breastmilk and therefore mothers are generally advised to avoid breastfeeding.

# Seek medical attention if you develop any of the following

-   Fever/flu-like illness
-   Mouth ulceration
-   Tiredness
-   Unexplained bruising or bleeding of the gums
-   Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or dark urine
-   Breathlessness or cough

Once the condition has stabilised on ciclosporin, your doctor will advise you to slowly reduce the daily dose of the medication to the minimum which controls its activity.  Intermittent dosing may be considered by your doctor.

Often it is necessary to stop it altogether for a few months to allow side effects to resolve. When ciclosporin is discontinued, the condition may slowly reappear. It can usually be retreated with further ciclosporin or another medication.
